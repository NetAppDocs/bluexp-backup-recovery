Before creating a backup of the SAP HANA database, you should add the SAP HANA database hosts and assign either a pre-canned policy or the policy that you created.

== Add SAP HANA database hosts

You should manually add SAP HANA database hosts to assign policies and create backups. Auto discovery of SAP HANA database host is not supported.

*What you will need*

* You should have added the working environment and created the Connector.
* Ensure that the Connector has connectivity to the working environment 
* Ensure that the BlueXP user has the “Account Admin” role.
* You should have deployed the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA. link:task-deploy-snapcenter-plugin-for-sap-hana.html[Learn more]
* While adding the SAP HANA database hosts, you should add the HDB user store keys. The HDB secure user store key is used to store the connection information of SAP HANA database hosts securely on the client and HDBSQL client uses the secure user store key to connect to SAP HANA database host.  
* For HANA System Replication (HSR), to protect the HANA systems, you should manually register both primary and secondary HANA systems.

*Steps*

.	In the *BlueXP* UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
.	Click *Discover Applications*.
.	Select *Cloud Native* > *SAP HANA* and click *Next*.
.	In the *Applications* page, click *Add System*.  
.	In the *System Details* page, perform the following actions:
..	Select the System Type as Multi-tenant database container or Single Container.
..	Enter the SAP HANA system name.
..	Specify the SID of the SAP HANA system.
..	(Optional) Specify HDBSQL OS user.
..	Select Plug-in host.  
(Optional) If the host is not added or if you want to add multiple hosts, click *Add Plug-in Host*.
..	If HANA system is configured with HANA System replication, enable *HANA System Replication (HSR) System*.
..	Click *HDB Secure User Store Keys* text box to add user store keys details.
+
Specify the key name, system details, username, and password and click *Add Key*.
+
You can delete or modify the user store keys.
+
NOTE: You should add user store keys for each host if you are adding a multi-host SAP HANA system.

.   Click *Next*.
.	In the *Storage Footprint* page, click *Add Storage* and perform the following:
..	Select the working environment and specify the NetApp account.
+
Go to *Canvas* page to add a new working environment
..	Select the required volumes.
..	Click *Add Storage*.
.	Review all the details and click *Add System*.

NOTE: The filter to view a specific host does not work. When you specify a host name in the filter, all the hosts are displayed

You can modify and remove the SAP HANA systems using REST API. Before removing the HANA system, you should delete all the associated backups and remove protection.

== Add Non-Data Volumes
After adding the multitenant database container or single container type SAP HANA system, you can add the Non-Data Volumes of the HANA system.

*Steps*

.   In the *BlueXP* UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
.	Click *Discover Applications*.
.	Select *Cloud Native* > *SAP HANA* and click *Next*.
.	In the *Applications* page, click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the system for which you want to add the Non-Data Volumes and select *Manage System* > *Non-Data Volume*.

== Add Global Non-Data Volumes
After adding the multitenant database container or single container type SAP HANA system, you can add the Global Non-Data Volumes of the HANA system.

*Steps*

.	In the *BlueXP* UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
.	Click *Discover Applications*.
.	Select *Cloud Native* > *SAP HANA* and click *Next*.
.	In the *Applications* page, click *Add System*.
.	In the *System Details* page, perform the following actions:
..	From System Type drop-down, select *Global Non-Data Volume*.
..	Enter the SAP HANA system name.
..	Specify the associated SIDs of the SAP HANA system.
..	Select the plug-in host
+
(Optional) To add multiple hosts, click on *Add Plug-in Host* and specify the host name and port and click *Add Host*.
..	Click *Next*.
..	Review all the details and click *Add System*.  

== Prescripts and postscripts

You can provide prescripts, postscripts, and exit scripts while creating a policy.  These scripts are run on the HANA host while creating backups. 

The supported format for scripts are .sh, python script, perl script, and so on.

The prescript and the postscript should be registered by the host admin into `/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc/allowed_commands.config file`

`[root@scspa2622265001 etc]# cat allowed_commands.config
command: mount
command: umount
command: /mnt/scripts/pre_script.sh
command: /mnt/scripts/post_script.sh`

== Environmental variables

For the restore workflow, the following environmental variables are available as part of prescript and postscript.

|===
| Environmental Variable | Description

a|
SID
a|
The System Identifier of the HANA Database chosen for restore
a|
BackupName
a|
Backup name chosen for restore operation
a|
UserStoreKeyNames
a|
Configured userstore key for the HANA database
a|
OSDBUser
a|
Configured OSDBUser for the HANA database
a|
PolicyName
a|
Only for scheduled backup
a|
Schedule_type 
a|
Only for scheduled backup
|===

== Create a policy for protecting SAP HANA database

You can create policies if you do not want to use or edit the pre-canned policies.

.	In the *Applications* page, from the Settings drop-down list, select *Policies*.
.	Click *Create policy*.
.	Specify a policy name.
.	(Optional) Edit the format of the Snapshot copy name.
.	Select policy type.
.	Specify the schedule and retention details.
.	(Optional) Specify the scripts.
.	Click *Create*.

== Create a backup of the SAP HANA Database

You can either assign a pre-canned policy or create a policy and then assign it to the database. Once the policy is assigned, the backups are created as per the schedule defined in the policy.

*About this task*

For HANA System Replication (HSR), the scheduled backup job will trigger only for the primary HANA system and if the system fails over to the secondary HANA system, the existing schedules will trigger a backup on the current primary HANA system. If the policy is not assigned to both the HANA system, after failover, the schedules will fail.

If different policies are assigned to the HSR systems, the scheduled backup will be triggered for both the systems and the backup will fail for the secondary HANA system.

*Steps*

. In the Applications page, if the database is not protected using any policy, click *Assign Policy*.
+
If the database is protected using one or more policies, you can assign more policies by clicking image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] > *Assign Policy*.
. Select the policy and click *Assign*.
+
The backups will be created as per the schedule defined in the policy.
+
NOTE: The service account (_SnapCenter-account-<account_id>_) is used for running the scheduled backup operations.

== Create on-demand backup of the SAP HANA database

After assigning the policy, you can create an on-demand backup of the application.

*Steps*

.	In the *Applications* page, click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action]  corresponding to the application and click *On-Demand Backup*.
.	Select On-demand backup type.
.	For Policy Based backup, select the policy, retention tier and then click *Create Backup*.
.	For One time, select either Snapshot copy based, or File based perform the following steps:
..	Select the retention value and specify the backup name.
..	(Optional) Specify the scripts, and path for the scripts.
..	Click *Create Backup*.
