The BlueXP backup and recovery service provides efficient, secure, and cost-effective data protection for ONTAP volumes, Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases, VMware workloads and Kubernetes workloads (Preview). 

NOTE: Some of this documentation is provided as a technology preview. With this preview offering, NetApp reserves the right to modify offering details, contents, and timeline before General Availability.   

== What you can do with BlueXP backup and recovery

Use BlueXP backup and recovery to accomplish the following goals:


* ONTAP volume workloads: 
**  Create local snapshots, replicate to secondary storage, and back up ONTAP volumes from on-premises ONTAP or Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems to object storage in your public or private cloud account. 

** Create block-level, incremental forever backups that are stored on another ONTAP cluster and in object storage in the cloud. 

* Microsoft SQL Server workloads: 

** Back up Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases from on-premises ONTAP, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, or Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. 
** Restore Microsoft SQL Server databases.
** Clone Microsoft SQL Server databases.

* VM workloads: 
** Back up datastores to Amazon Web Services S3, Microsoft Azure Blob, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID and restore virtual machines back to the on-premises SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host. 

** Restore virtual machines data from the cloud back to the on-premises vCenter with BlueXP backup and recovery. 

* Kubernetes workloads (Preview): 
** Manage and protect your Kubernetes applications and resources all in one place.
** Use protection policies to structure your incremental backups.
** Restore applications and resources to the same or different clusters and namespaces.

//TIP: When the BlueXP Connector is deployed in a government region in the cloud, or in a site without internet access (a dark site), BlueXP backup and recovery supports backup and restore operations only from ONTAP systems. When you use these deployment methods, BlueXP backup and recovery does not support backup and restore operations from applications.


== Benefits of using BlueXP backup and recovery

BlueXP backup and recovery provides the following benefits:

* **Efficient**: BlueXP backup and recovery performs block-level, incremental-forever replication, which significantly reduces the amount of data that's replicated and stored. This helps to minimize network traffic and storage costs.

* **Secure**: BlueXP backup and recovery encrypts data in transit and at rest, and it uses secure communication protocols to protect your data.

* **Cost-effective**: BlueXP backup and recovery uses the lowest-cost storage tiers available in your cloud account, which helps to reduce costs.   

* **Automated**: BlueXP backup and recovery automatically generates backups based on a predefined schedule, which helps to ensure that your data is protected.

* **Flexible**: BlueXP backup and recovery enables you to restore data to the same or different working environment, which provides flexibility in data recovery.



== Cost 

NetApp doesn't charge you for using the trial version. However, you are responsible for the costs associated with the cloud resources that you use, such as storage and data transfer costs.  

There are two types of costs associated with using the backup-to-object feature of BlueXP backup and recovery with ONTAP systems: 

* Resource charges  
* Service charges

There is no charge to create snapshot copies or replicated volumes - other than the disk space required to store the snapshot copies and replicated volumes.

*Resource charges*

Resource charges are paid to the cloud provider for object storage capacity and for writing and reading backup files to the cloud.

* For Backup to object storage, you pay your cloud provider for object storage costs.
+
Because BlueXP backup and recovery preserves the storage efficiencies of the source volume, you pay the cloud provider object storage costs for the data _after_ ONTAP efficiencies (for the smaller amount of data after deduplication and compression have been applied).

* For restoring data using Search & Restore, certain resources are provisioned by your cloud provider, and there is per-TiB cost associated with the amount of data that is scanned by your search requests. (These resources are not needed for Browse & Restore.)

* If you plan to restore volume data from a backup file that has been moved to archival object storage, then there's an additional per-GiB retrieval fee and per-request fee from the cloud provider.

* If you plan to scan a backup file for ransomware during the process of restoring volume data (if you enabled DataLock and Ransomware Protection for your cloud backups), then you'll incur extra egress costs from your cloud provider as well.

*Service charges*

Service charges are paid to NetApp and cover both the cost to _create_ backups to object storage and to _restore_ volumes, or files, from those backups. You pay only for the data that you protect in object storage, calculated by the source logical used capacity (_before_ ONTAP efficiencies) of ONTAP volumes that are backed up to object storage. This capacity is also known as Front-End Terabytes (FETB).

NOTE: For Microsoft SQL Server, charges apply when you initiate the replication of snapshots to a secondary ONTAP target or object storage.

There are three ways to pay for the Backup service: 

* The first option is to subscribe from your cloud provider, which enables you to pay per month. 
* The second option is to get an annual contract. 
* The third option is to purchase licenses directly from NetApp. Read the <<Licensing,Licensing>> section for details.


== Licensing 

BlueXP backup and recovery is available as a free trial. You can use the service without a license key for a limited time.

BlueXP backup and recovery is available with the following consumption models:

* *Bring your own license (BYOL)*: A license purchased from NetApp that can be used with any cloud provider.
* *Pay as you go (PAYGO)*: An hourly subscription from your cloud provider's marketplace.
* *Annual*: An annual contract from your cloud provider's marketplace.

A Backup license is required only for backup and restore from object storage. Creating Snapshot copies and replicated volumes do not require a license.

*Bring your own license*

BYOL is term-based (1, 2, or 3 years) _and_ capacity-based in 1-TiB increments. You pay NetApp to use the service for a period of time, say 1 year, and for a maximum amount capacity, say 10 TiB.

You'll receive a serial number that you enter in the BlueXP digital wallet page to enable the service. When either limit is reached, you'll need to renew the license. The Backup BYOL license applies to all source systems associated with your BlueXP organization or account.

*Pay-as-you-go subscription*

BlueXP backup and recovery offers consumption-based licensing in a pay-as-you-go model. After subscribing through your cloud provider's marketplace, you pay per GiB for data that's backed up â€” there's no up-front payment. You are billed by your cloud provider through your monthly bill.

Note that a 30-day free trial is available when you initially sign up with a PAYGO subscription.

*Annual contract*

//ifdef::aws[]
When you use AWS, two annual contracts are available for 1, 2, or 3 years:

* A "Cloud Backup" plan that enables you to back up Cloud Volumes ONTAP data and on-premises ONTAP data.

* A "CVO Professional" plan that enables you to bundle Cloud Volumes ONTAP and BlueXP backup and recovery. This includes unlimited backups for Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes charged against this license (backup capacity is not counted against the license).
//endif::aws[]

//ifdef::azure[]

== BlueXP backup and recovery uses the Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server

BlueXP backup and recovery installs the Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server on the server that hosts Microsoft SQL Server. The  Plug-in is a host-side component that enables application-aware data protection management of Microsoft SQL Server databases and instances. 




== How BlueXP backup and recovery works

When you enable BlueXP backup and recovery, the service performs a full backup of your data. After the initial backup, all additional backups are incremental. This keeps network traffic to a minimum.


The following image shows the relationship among components.

=== Where backups reside in object store locations

Backup copies are stored in an object store that BlueXP creates in your cloud account. There's one object store per cluster or working environment, and BlueXP names the object store as follows: `netapp-backup-clusteruuid`. Be sure not to delete this object store.

//ifdef::aws[]
* In AWS, BlueXP enables the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html[Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature^] on the S3 bucket.
//endif::aws[]

//ifdef::azure[]
* In Azure, BlueXP uses a new or existing resource group with a storage account for the Blob container. BlueXP https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/anonymous-read-access-prevent[blocks public access to your blob data] by default.
//endif::azure[]

//ifdef::gcp[]
//* In GCP, BlueXP uses a new or existing project with a storage account for the Google Cloud Storage bucket.
endif::gcp[]

* In StorageGRID, BlueXP uses an existing storage account for the object store bucket.

* In ONTAP S3, BlueXP uses an existing user account for the S3 bucket.


=== Backup copies are associated with your BlueXP organization

Backup copies are associated with the BlueXP organization in which the BlueXP Connector resides. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-identity-and-access-management.html[Learn about BlueXP identity and access management^].

If you have multiple Connectors in the same BlueXP organization, each Connector displays the same list of backups.
