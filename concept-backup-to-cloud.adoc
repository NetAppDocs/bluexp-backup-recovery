The BlueXP backup and recovery service provides efficient, secure, and cost-effective data protection for Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases, both on premises and in the cloud. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account.


//NOTE: THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED AS A TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW.  With this preview offering, NetApp reserves the right to modify offering details, contents, and timeline before General Availability.   


== What you can do with BlueXP backup and recovery

Use BlueXP backup and recovery to accomplish the following goals:

* Back up Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases from on-premises ONTAP or Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. 

* Restore databases to the same or alternate host, which provides flexibility in data recovery.


//TIP: When the BlueXP Connector is deployed in a government region in the cloud, or in a site without internet access (a dark site), BlueXP backup and recovery supports backup and restore operations only from ONTAP systems. When you use these deployment methods, BlueXP backup and recovery does not support backup and restore operations from applications.


== Benefits of using BlueXP backup and recovery

BlueXP backup and recovery provides the following benefits:

* **Efficient**: BlueXP backup and recovery performs block-level, incremental-forever replication, which significantly reduces the amount of data that's replicated and stored. This helps to minimize network traffic and storage costs.

* **Secure**: BlueXP backup and recovery encrypts data in transit and at rest, and it uses secure communication protocols to protect your data.

* **Cost-effective**: BlueXP backup and recovery uses the lowest-cost storage tiers available in your cloud account, which helps to reduce costs.   

* **Automated**: BlueXP backup and recovery automatically generates backups based on a predefined schedule, which helps to ensure that your data is protected.

* **Flexible**: BlueXP backup and recovery enables you to restore data to the same or different working environment, which provides flexibility in data recovery.



== Cost 

NetApp doesn't charge you for using the trial version. However, you are responsible for the costs associated with the cloud resources that you use, such as storage and data transfer costs.    

== Licensing 

BlueXP backup and recovery version is available as a free trial. You can use the service without a license key for a limited time.

== Supported data sources, working environments, backup targets and destinations, and restore destinations

* NetApp StorageGRID


.Supported backup destinations

BlueXP backup and recovery enables you to back up Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases from the following source working environments to the following secondary working environments and object storage in public and private cloud providers. Snapshot copies reside on the source working environment.

.Supported restore destinations

You can restore Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases from a backup that resides in primary storage or a secondary working environment (a replicated volume) or in object storage (a backup file) to the following working environments. Snapshot copies reside on the source working environment and can be restored only to that same system.

== BlueXP backup and recovery uses the SnapCenter Plugin for Microsoft SQL Server

BlueXP backup and recovery installs the Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server on the server that hosts MS SQL Server. The  Plug-in is a host-side component that enables application-aware data protection management of Microsoft SQL Server databases and instances. 


== How BlueXP backup and recovery works

When you enable BlueXP backup and recovery, the service performs a full backup of your data. After the initial backup, all additional backups are incremental. This keeps network traffic to a minimum.

NOTE: Primary to object storage is also supported, not just from secondary storage to object storage.

=== Where backups reside in object store locations

Backup copies are stored in an object store that BlueXP creates in your cloud account. There's one object store per cluster or working environment, and BlueXP names the object store as follows: `netapp-backup-clusteruuid`. Be sure not to delete this object store.

//ifdef::aws[]
* In AWS, BlueXP enables the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html[Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature^] on the S3 bucket.
//endif::aws[]

//ifdef::azure[]
* In Azure, BlueXP uses a new or existing resource group with a storage account for the Blob container. BlueXP https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/anonymous-read-access-prevent[blocks public access to your blob data] by default.
//endif::azure[]

//ifdef::gcp[]
//* In GCP, BlueXP uses a new or existing project with a storage account for the Google Cloud Storage bucket.
endif::gcp[]

* In StorageGRID, BlueXP uses an existing storage account for the object store bucket.

//* In ONTAP S3, BlueXP uses an existing user account for the S3 bucket.


=== Backup copies are associated with your NetApp account

Backup copies are associated with the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-netapp-accounts.html[BlueXP account^] in which the BlueXP Connector resides.

If you have multiple Connectors in the same BlueXP account, each Connector displays the same list of backups. 

== Terms that might help you with BlueXP backup and recovery 

You might benefit by understanding some terminology related to protection.

* *Protection*: Protection in BlueXP backup and recovery means ensuring that snapshots and immutable backups occur on a regular basis to a different security domain using protection policies.

//* *Workload*: A workload in BlueXP backup and recovery Preview version can include MySQL or Oracle databases, VMware datastores, or file shares.
* *Workload*: A workload in BlueXP backup and recovery can include Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases.
