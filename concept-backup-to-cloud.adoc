[.lead]
The BlueXP backup and recovery service provides efficient, secure, and cost-effective data protection for Microsoft SQL Server databases, both on premises and in the cloud. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account.

The service performs block-level, incremental-forever replication and preserves all storage efficiencies, which significantly reduces the amount of data that's replicated and stored. Additionally, you pay only for what's protected and use the lowest-cost storage tiers available, which makes BlueXP backup and recovery very cost effective.

== What you can do with BlueXP backup and recovery

Use BlueXP backup and recovery Preview 2025 version to accomplish the following goals:

* Back up and restore ONTAP volume data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems. 
//link:concept-ontap-backup-to-cloud.html[See detailed features here].
* Back up the application-consistent Snapshots from on-premises ONTAP systems using BlueXP backup and recovery for applications.
// link:concept-protect-app-data-to-cloud.html[See detailed features here].
//* Back up datastores to the cloud and restore virtual machines back to the on-premises vCenter using BlueXP backup and recovery for VMware. link:concept-protect-vm-data.html[See detailed features here].


//TIP: When the BlueXP Connector is deployed in a government region in the cloud, or in a site without internet access (a dark site), BlueXP backup and recovery supports backup and restore operations only from ONTAP systems. When you use these deployment methods, BlueXP backup and recovery does not support backup and restore operations from applications.

BlueXP backup and recovery Preview version works only in standard deployment mode, not restricted or private modes. 

== Benefits of using BlueXP backup and recovery

BlueXP backup and recovery provides the following benefits:

* **Efficient**: BlueXP backup and recovery performs block-level, incremental-forever replication, which significantly reduces the amount of data that's replicated and stored. This helps to minimize network traffic and storage costs.

* **Secure**: BlueXP backup and recovery encrypts data in transit and at rest, and it uses secure communication protocols to protect your data.

* **Cost-effective**: BlueXP backup and recovery uses the lowest-cost storage tiers available in your cloud account, which helps to reduce costs.   

* **Automated**: BlueXP backup and recovery automatically generates backups based on a predefined schedule, which helps to ensure that your data is protected.

* **Flexible**: BlueXP backup and recovery allows you to restore data to the same or different working environment, which provides flexibility in data recovery.

== How BlueXP backup and recovery works

When you enable BlueXP backup and recovery on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP or on-premises ONTAP system, the service performs a full backup of your data. Volume snapshots are not included in the backup image. After the initial backup, all additional backups are incremental, which means that only changed blocks and new blocks are backed up. This keeps network traffic to a minimum.

//In most cases you'll use the BlueXP UI for all backup operations. However, starting with ONTAP 9.9.1 you can initiate volume backup operations of your on-premises ONTAP clusters using ONTAP System Manager. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_cloud_backup_data_using_cbs.html[See how to use System Manager to back up your volumes to the cloud using BlueXP backup and recovery.^]

=== Where backups reside

Backup copies are stored in an object store that BlueXP creates in your cloud account. There's one object store per cluster/working environment, and BlueXP names the object store as follows: `netapp-backup-clusteruuid`. Be sure not to delete this object store.

ifdef::aws[]
* In AWS, BlueXP enables the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html[Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature^] on the S3 bucket.
endif::aws[]

ifdef::azure[]
* In Azure, BlueXP uses a new or existing resource group with a storage account for the Blob container. BlueXP https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/anonymous-read-access-prevent[blocks public access to your blob data] by default.
endif::azure[]

ifdef::gcp[]
* In GCP, BlueXP uses a new or existing project with a storage account for the Google Cloud Storage bucket.
endif::gcp[]

* In StorageGRID, BlueXP uses an existing storage account for the object store bucket.

* In ONTAP S3, BlueXP uses an existing user account for the S3 bucket.

=== When backups are taken

* Hourly backups start 5 minutes past the hour, every hour.

* Daily backups start just after midnight each day.

* Weekly backups start just after midnight on Sunday mornings.

* Monthly backups start just after midnight on the first day of each month.

* Yearly backups start just after midnight on the first day of the year.

The start time is based on the time zone set on each source ONTAP system. You can't schedule backup operations at a user-specified time from the UI. For more information, contact your System Engineer.

=== Backup copies are associated with your NetApp account

Backup copies are associated with the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-netapp-accounts.html[NetApp account^] in which the BlueXP Connector resides.

If you have multiple Connectors in the same NetApp account, each Connector displays the same list of backups. That includes the backups associated with Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP instances from other Connectors.

== Terms that might help you with BlueXP backup and recovery 

You might benefit by understanding some terminology related to protection.
