In the event of data loss, you can restore the data files, control files, or both and then recover the database.

*Before you begin*

If the Oracle 21c database is in STARTED state, the restore operation fails. You should run the following command to restore the database successfully.
`cp -f <ORACLE_HOME>/jdbc/lib/ojdbc8.jar /opt/NetApp/snapcenter/spl/plugins/sco/lib/ojdbc8-8.jar`

*Steps*

. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the database that you want to restore and click *Restore*.
. Select the restore point to which the database should be restored and click *Restore to original location*.
. In the Restore Scope section, perform the following actions:
