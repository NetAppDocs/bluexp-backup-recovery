You can restore virtual machines from the cloud back to the on-premises vCenter. The backup will be restored to the exact same location from where the backup was taken. You cannot restore the backup to any other alternate location. You can restore virtual machines from the datastore or from the VMs view.

NOTE: You cannot restore virtual machines that are spanned across datastores.

.What you'll need

Ensure that you have met all the link:concept-protect-vm-data.html#Requirements[requirements] before restoring virtual machines from the cloud.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, click *Backup & Restore* > *Virtual Machines* > *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere* and select the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere whose virtual machine you want to restore.

NOTE: If the source virtual machine is moved to another location (vMotion), and if the user triggers a restore of that virtual machine from Cloud Manager, then the virtual machine will get restored to the original source location from where the backup was taken.
