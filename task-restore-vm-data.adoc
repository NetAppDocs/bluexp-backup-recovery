You can restore virtual machines from the cloud back to the on-premises vCenter. The backup will be restored to the exact same location from where the backup was taken. If the virtual machine was backed up using archival policy, then you can set the archival restore priority. 

NOTE: You cannot restore virtual machines that span across datastores.

== Before you begin
Ensure that you have met all the link:concept-protect-vm-data.html#Requirements[requirements] before restoring virtual machines from the cloud.

.Steps

. In BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Virtual Machines* > *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere* and select the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host.

NOTE: If the source virtual machine is moved to another location (vMotion), and if the user triggers a restore of that virtual machine from BlueXP, then the virtual machine is restored to the original source location from where the backup was taken.
