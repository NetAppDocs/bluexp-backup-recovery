You can back up one or more datastores to StorageGRID by integrating the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host with BlueXP backup and recovery. This will help the VM administrators to easily and quickly back up and archive data for storage efficiency and accelerate cloud transition.

.Before you begin
Ensure that you have met all the link:concept-protect-vm-data.html[requirements] before backing up datastores to the cloud.
