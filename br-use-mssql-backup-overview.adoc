summary: You can back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and StorageGRID, ensuring that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

Back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and StorageGRID to ensure that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:

* Multiple data copies provide multi-layer protection against both internal (insider) and external cybersecurity threats.
* Multiple media types ensure failover viability in the case of physical or logical failure of one media type.
* The onsite copy facilitates quick restores, with the offsite copies available just in case the onsite copy is compromised.

BlueXP backup and recovery leverages NetApp SnapMirror data replication technology to ensure that all the backups are fully synchronized by creating snapshot copies and transferring them to the backup locations.

You can accomplish the following protection goals: 

* Back up workloads with local snapshots on local ONTAP primary storage
* Replicate workloads to ONTAP secondary storage
* Back up workloads to an object store location 
* Back up workloads now with ad hoc backups 

To back up workloads, typically you create policies that govern the backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for more information.
