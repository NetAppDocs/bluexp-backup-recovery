= Backup-to-object policy options in BlueXP backup and recovery
:hardbreaks:

[.lead]
BlueXP backup and recovery enables you to create backup policies with a variety of settings for your on-prem ONTAP and Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

NOTE: These policy settings are relevant for backup-to-object storage only. None of these settings affect your Snapshot or replication policies.

*NOTE*   This feature uses a previous version of the BlueXP backup and recovery UI. To switch to and from BlueXP backup and recovery UI versions, refer to link:br-start-switch-ui.html[Switch to the previous BlueXP backup and recovery UI].
====

== Backup schedule options

BlueXP backup and recovery enables you to create multiple backup policies with unique schedules for each working environment (cluster). You can assign different backup policies to volumes that have different recovery point objectives (RPO).

Each backup policy provides a section for _Labels & Retention_ that you can apply to your backup files. Note that the Snapshot policy applied to the volume must be one of the policies recognized by BlueXP backup and recovery or backup files will not be created. 

image:screenshot_backup_schedule_settings.png[A screenshot of the Backup Schedule settings when creating a backup policy.]

There are two parts of the schedule; the Label and the Retention value:

* The *label* defines how often a backup file is created (or updated) from the volume. You can select among the following types of labels:

** You can choose one, or a combination of, *hourly*, *daily*, *weekly*, *monthly*, and *yearly* timeframes.
** You can select one of the system-defined policies that provide backup and retention for 3 months, 1 year, or 7 years.
** If you have created custom backup protection policies on the cluster using ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI, you can select one of those policies.

* The *retention* value defines how many backup files for each label (timeframe) are retained. Once the maximum number of backups have been reached in a category, or interval, older backups are removed so you always have the most current backups. This also saves you storage costs because obsolete backups don't continue to take up space in the cloud.

For example, say you create a backup policy that creates 7 *weekly* and 12 *monthly* backups:

* each week and each month a backup file is created for the volume
* at the 8th week, the first weekly backup is removed, and the new weekly backup for the 8th week is added (keeping a maximum of 7 weekly backups)
* at the 13th month, the first monthly backup is removed, and the new monthly backup for the 13th month is added (keeping a maximum of 12 monthly backups)

Yearly backups are deleted automatically from the source system after being transferred to object storage. This default behavior can be changed in the Advanced Settings page for the Working Environment.

== DataLock and Ransomware protection options

BlueXP backup and recovery provides support for DataLock and Ransomware protection for your volume backups. These features enable you to lock your backup files and scan them to detect possible ransomware on the backup files. This is an optional setting that you can define in your backup policies when you want extra protection for your volume backups for a cluster.

Both of these features protect your backup files so that you'll always have a valid backup file to recover data from in case of a ransomware attack attempt on your backups. It's also helpful to meet certain regulatory requirements where backups need to be locked and retained for a certain period of time. When the DataLock and Ransomware Protection option is enabled, the cloud bucket that is provisioned as a part of BlueXP backup and recovery activation will have object locking and object versioning enabled.

https://bluexp.netapp.com/blog/cbs-blg-the-bluexp-feature-that-protects-backups-from-ransomware[See the DataLock and Ransomware protection blog for more details^].

This feature does not provide protection for your source volumes; only for the backups of those source volumes. Use some of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[anti-ransomware protections provided from ONTAP^] to protect your source volumes.

[CAUTION]
====
* If you plan to use DataLock and Ransomware protection, you can enable it when creating your first backup policy and activating BlueXP backup and recovery for that cluster. You can later enable or disable ransomware scanning using BlueXP backup and recovery Advanced Settings. 
* When BlueXP scans a backup file for ransomware when restoring volume data, you'll incur extra egress costs from your cloud provider to access the contents of the backup file.

=== What is DataLock

DataLock protects your backup files from being modified or deleted for a certain period of time - also called _immutable storage_. This functionality uses technology from the object storage provider for "object locking." The period of time that the backup file is locked (and retained) is called the DataLock Retention Period. It is based on the backup policy schedule and retention setting that you defined, plus a maximum 31-day buffer. Any DataLock retention policy that is less than 31 days is rounded up to 31 days minimum.

Be aware that old backups are deleted after the DataLock Retention Period expires, not after the backup policy retention period expires.

Let's look at some examples of how this works:

* If you create a Monthly backup schedule with 12 retentions, each backup is locked for 12 months (plus a maximum 31-day buffer) before it is deleted.
* If you create a backup policy that creates 30 daily, 7 weekly, 12 monthly backups there will be three locked retention periods. The "30 daily" backups would be retained for 44 days (30 days plus a maximum 31-day buffer), the "7 weekly" backups would be retained for 9 weeks (7 weeks plus a maximum 31-day buffer), and the "12 monthly" backups would be retained for 12 months (plus a maximum 31-day buffer).
* If you create an Hourly backup schedule with 24 retentions, you might think that backups are locked for 24 hours. However, since that is less than the minimum of 30 days, each backup will be locked and retained for 44 days (30 days plus a maximum 31-day buffer).
+
You can see in this last case that if each backup file is locked for 30 days (plus a maximum 31-day buffer), you'll end up with many more backup files than would typically be retained with an hourly/24 retentions policy. Usually, when BlueXP backup and recovery creates the 25th backup file it would delete the oldest backup to keep the maximum retentions at 24 (based on the policy). The DataLock retention setting overrides the policy retention setting from your backup policy in this case. This could affect your storage costs as your backup files will be saved in the object store for a longer period of time.

=== What is Ransomware protection

Ransomware protection scans your backup files to look for evidence of a ransomware attack. The detection of ransomware attacks is performed using a checksum comparison. If potential ransomware is identified in a new backup file versus the previous backup file, that newer backup file is replaced by the most recent backup file that does not show any signs of a ransomware attack. (The file that was identified as having a ransomware attack is deleted 1 day after it has been replaced.)

Ransomware scans happen at the following points in the backup and restore process:

* When a backup file is created.
+ 
You can optionally enable or disable ransomware scans. 
+
The scan is not performed on the backup file when it is first written to cloud storage, but when the *next* backup file is written. For example, if you have a weekly backup schedule set for Tuesday, on Tuesday the 14th a backup is created. Then on Tuesday the 21st another backup is created. The ransomware scan is run on the backup file from the 14th at this time.
* When you attempt to restore data from a backup file
+
You can choose to run a scan before restoring data from a backup file, or skip this scan.
* Manually
+
You can run an on-demand ransomware protection scan at any time to verify the health of a specific backup file. This can be useful if you've had a ransomware issue on a particular volume and you want to verify that the backups for that volume are not affected.

=== DataLock and Ransomware Protection options

Each backup policy provides a section for _DataLock and Ransomware Protection_ that you can apply to your backup files.

image:screenshot_datalock_ransomware_settings.png["A screenshot of the DataLock and Ransomware Protection settings for AWS, Azure, and StorageGRID when creating a backup policy."]

Ransomware protection scans are enabled by default. The default setting for the scan frequency is for 7 days. The scan occurs only on the latest Snapshot copy. You can enable or disable ransomware scans on the latest Snapshot copy by using the option on the Advanced Settings page. If you enable it, scans are performed every 7 days by default. 

You can change that schedule to days or weeks or disable it, saving costs.  

Refer to link:prev-ontap-policy-object-advanced-settings.html[How to update Ransomware protection options in the Advanced Settings page].

You can choose from the following settings for each backup policy:

=== Restrictions

* The DataLock and Ransomware protection feature is not available if you have configured archival storage in the backup policy.
* The DataLock option you select when activating BlueXP backup and recovery must be used for all backup policies for that cluster. 
* You cannot use multiple DataLock modes on a single cluster.
* If you enable DataLock, all volume backups will be locked. You can't mix locked and non-locked volume backups for a single cluster.
* DataLock and Ransomware protection is applicable for new volume backups using a backup policy with DataLock and Ransomware protection enabled. You can later enable or disable these features using the Advanced Settings option. 
* FlexGroup volumes can use DataLock and Ransomware protection only when using ONTAP 9.13.1 or greater.

=== Tips on how to mitigate DataLock costs

You can enable or disable the Ransomware Scan feature while keeping the DataLock feature active. To avoid extra charges, you can disable scheduled ransomware scans. This lets you customize your security settings and avoid incurring costs from the cloud provider. 

Even if scheduled ransomware scans are disabled, you can still perform on-demand scans when needed.

You can choose different levels of protection: 

* *DataLock _without_ ransomware scans*: Provides protection for backup data in the destination storage that can be either in Governance or Compliance mode. 

** *Governance mode*: Offers flexibility to administrators to overwrite or delete protected data. 
** *Compliance mode*: Provides complete indelibility until the retention period expires. This helps meet the most stringent data security requirements of highly regulated environments. The data cannot be overwritten or modified during its lifecycle, providing the strongest level of protection for your backup copies. 
+
NOTE: Microsoft Azure uses a Lock and Unlock mode instead.

* *DataLock _with_ ransomware scans*: Provides an additional layer of security for your data. This feature helps detect any attempts to change backup copies. If any attempt is made, a new version of the data is created discreetly. The scan frequency can be changed to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days. If scans are set to every 7 days, the costs decrease significantly.

== Archival storage options

When using AWS, Azure, or Google cloud storage, you can move older backup files to a less expensive archival storage class or access tier after a certain number of days. You can also choose to send your backup files to archival storage immediately without being written to standard cloud storage. Just enter *0* as the "Archive After Days" to send your backup file directly to archival storage. This can be especially helpful for users who rarely need to access data from cloud backups or users who are replacing a backup to tape solution.

Data in archival tiers can't be accessed immediately when needed, and will require a higher retrieval cost, so you'll need to consider how often you may need to restore data from backup files before deciding to archive your backup files. 

[NOTE]
====
* Even if you select “0” to send all data blocks to archival cloud storage, metadata blocks are always written to standard cloud storage. 
* Archival storage can't be used if you have enabled DataLock.
* You can't change the archival policy after selecting *0* days (archive immediately).
====

Each backup policy provides a section for _Archival Policy_ that you can apply to your backup files.

image:screenshot_archive_tier_settings.png[A screenshot of the Archival Policy settings when creating a backup policy.]

ifdef::aws[]
* In AWS, backups start in the _Standard_ storage class and transition to the _Standard-Infrequent Access_ storage class after 30 days.
+
If your cluster is using ONTAP 9.10.1 or greater, you can tier older backups to either _S3 Glacier_ or _S3 Glacier Deep Archive_ storage. link:prev-reference-aws-archive-storage-tiers.html[Learn more about AWS archival storage].
+
** If you select no archive tier in your first backup policy when activating BlueXP backup and recovery, then _S3 Glacier_ will be your only archive option for future policies.
** If you select _S3 Glacier_ in your first backup policy, then you can change to the _S3 Glacier Deep Archive_ tier for future backup policies for that cluster.
** If you select _S3 Glacier Deep Archive_ in your first backup policy, then that tier will be the only archive tier available for future backup policies for that cluster.
endif::aws[]

ifdef::azure[]
* In Azure, backups are associated with the _Cool_ access tier.
+
If your cluster is using ONTAP 9.10.1 or greater, you can tier older backups to _Azure Archive_ storage. link:prev-reference-azure-archive-storage-tiers.html[Learn more about Azure archival storage].
endif::azure[]

ifdef::gcp[]
* In GCP, backups are associated with the _Standard_ storage class.
+
If your on-prem cluster is using ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater, you can choose to tier older backups to _Archive_ storage in the BlueXP backup and recovery UI after a certain number of days for further cost optimization. link:prev-reference-gcp-archive-storage-tiers.html[Learn more about Google archival storage].
//You can use the lower cost _Nearline_ storage class, or the _Coldline_ or _Archive_ storage classes. However, you configure these other storage classes through Google, not through the BlueXP backup and recovery UI. See the Google topic https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes[Storage classes^] for information about changing the default storage class for a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
endif::gcp[]

* In StorageGRID, backups are associated with the _Standard_ storage class.
+
If your on-prem cluster is using ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater, and your StorageGRID system is using 11.4 or greater, you can archive older backup files to public cloud archival storage.
