To use BlueXP backup and recovery, the service needs to first discover data. During discovery, BlueXP backup and recovery analyzes all volumes and files in working environments across all BlueXP Connectors and projects within an organization. 

For the Preview 2025 version, BlueXP backup and recovery assesses Microsoft SQL Server applications. 

NOTE: Workloads with volumes that use FlexGroup or iSCSI will not be discovered. 

The service assesses the existing protection level including the current backup protection, Snapshot copies, and NetApp Autonomous backup and recovery options.
