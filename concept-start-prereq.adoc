Get started with BlueXP backup and recovery by verifying the readiness of your operational environment, BlueXP Connector, and BlueXP account. To use BlueXP backup and recovery, you'll need these prerequisites.


== For ONTAP 9.8 and later

An ONTAP One license must be enabled on the on-premises ONTAP instance.


//* To apply advanced protection configurations (such as enabling DataLock and others), BlueXP backup and recovery needs admin permissions on the ONTAP cluster. The ONTAP cluster should have been onboarded using ONTAP cluster admin user credentials only. 

//* If the ONTAP cluster is already onboarded in BlueXP using non-admin user credentials, then the non-admin user permissions must be updated with necessary permissions by logging into the ONTAP cluster, described on this page. 


== For backups to object storage

To use object storage as backup targets, you need an account with AWS S3, Microsoft Azure Blob, StorageGRID, or ONTAP and the appropriate access permissions configured.

* link:br-use-mssql-protect-overview.html[Protect your Microsoft SQL Server databases]
* link:prev-vmware-protect-overview.html[Protect your VMware workloads]

//* link:br-use-kubernetes-protect-overview.html[Protect your Kubernetes workloads]


//== For protecting Kubernetes applications
//You need specific requirements to discover Kubernetes resources and protect your Kubernetes applications.


//* You need a primary ONTAP system 
//* You need a Kubernetes cluster in your environment
//** Kubernetes distributions / versions supported
//** Trident must be installed
//* BlueXP Connector needs to be installed (already documented in BXP docs, link to it)
//* You need to have installed a BlueXP working environment
//** The working environment needs to have storage volumes configured and useable by BlueXP.
//* You need to have hardware or VMs available for a new Kubernetes cluster (or you need an existing cluster)

//*Kubernetes requirements for 3-2-1 protection scheme*
//BlueXP backup and recovery supports Kubernetes application data protection using the 3-2-1 backup scheme. If you want to use this backup scheme, ensure you have the following:

//* A working replication relationship between your ONTAP systems
//* Offsite cloud / object storage buckets to serve as the offsite storage (list supported providers)



== In BlueXP 


* A BlueXP user should have the required role and privileges to perform operations on Microsoft SQL Server workloads. To discover the resources, you must have the BlueXP backup and recovery role of Super admin. See link:reference-roles.html[BlueXP backup and recovery role-based access to features] for details about the roles and permissions required to perform operations in BlueXP backup and recovery.

* A BlueXP organization with at least one active BlueXP Connector that connects to on-premises ONTAP clusters or Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Refer to the *Initial Preview setup process* below. 
//* A BlueXP organization with at least one active BlueXP Connector that connects to on-premises ONTAP clusters or to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS or Azure.


* At least one BlueXP working environment with a NetApp on-premises ONTAP or Cloud Volumes ONTAP cluster.
//* At least one BlueXP working environment with a NetApp on-premises ONTAP cluster or Cloud Volume ONTAP in AWS or Azure (using NAS or CIFS protocols).

* A BlueXP Connector

Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn how to configure a BlueXP Connector] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-checklist-cm.html[standard BlueXP requirements^].

** The Preview version requires the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS operating system for the Connector. 

//RHEL connector will be supported during GA.
 


//All source and working environments must be in the same BlueXP organization. 



=== Set up BlueXP
The next step is to set up BlueXP and the BlueXP backup and recovery service. 

Review https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-checklist-cm.html[standard BlueXP requirements^].


=== Create a BlueXP Connector

You should reach out to your NetApp Product Team to try out this service. Then, when you use the BlueXP Connector, it will include the appropriate capabilities for the service. 

To create a Connector in BlueXP before using the service, refer to the BlueXP documentation that describes https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[how to create a BlueXP Connector^]. 


.Where to install the BlueXP Connector

To complete a restore operation, the Connector can be installed in the following locations:

ifdef::aws[]
* For Amazon S3, the Connector can be deployed on your premises. 
endif::aws[]
ifdef::azure[]
* For Azure Blob, the Connector can be deployed on your premises. 
endif::azure[]
//ifdef::gcp[]
//* For Google Cloud Storage, the Connector must be deployed in your Google Cloud Platform VPC.
//endif::gcp[]

* For StorageGRID, the Connector must be deployed in your premises; with or without internet access.
* For ONTAP S3, the Connector can be deployed in your premises (with or without internet access) or in a cloud provider environment

NOTE: References to "on-premises ONTAP systems" includes FAS and AFF systems.



//== Script to run before moving snapshots to object storage

//If you plan to move snapshots to object storage, run a temporary script one time soon after creating a BlueXP Connector. The script retrieves information from BlueXP backup and recovery and enables notifications when transfers of snapshots are moved to object storage. 


//----
//[source,asciidoc]

//#!/bin/bash

//# Define container name and configuration file path inside the container
//CONTAINER_NAME="cloudmanager_cbs"
//CONFIG_FILE="config/default.json"

//echo "Enabling pubsub in the container: ${CONTAINER_NAME}..."

//# Use sed to replace the "enable": value only within the pubsub-feature block.
//# The sed command sets the block range from the line matching "pubsub-feature" and an opening brace '{'
//# until the first encountered '}' (assumed to be the closing of the block).
//docker exec -it "${CONTAINER_NAME}" bash -c "sed -i '////\"pubsub-feature\"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*{/,/}/ s/\"enable\":[[:space:]]*\\(true\\|false\\)/\"enable\": true/' ${CONFIG_FILE}"

//if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
//    echo "Configuration updated successfully."
//else
//    echo "Failed to update configuration."
//    exit 1
//fi

//echo "Restarting container: ${CONTAINER_NAME}..."
//docker restart "${CONTAINER_NAME}"

//if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
//    echo "Container restarted successfully."
//else
//    echo "Failed to restart container."
//   exit 1
//fi
