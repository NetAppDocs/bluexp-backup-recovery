| Minimum install and log space for the plug-in on the host
| 5 GB

Allocate sufficient disk space and monitor the storage consumption by the logs folder. The log space required varies depending on the number of backups performed and the frequency of data protection operations. If there is not sufficient space, the logs will not be created for the operations. 

|Required software packages if using SnapCenter 6.0 or greater
| * ASP.NET Core Runtime 8.0.12 Hosting Bundle (and all subsequent 8.0.x patches)

* Java 11 Oracle Java and OpenJDK

== In BlueXP 


* A BlueXP user account with Organization Admin privileges for discovering resources.

* A BlueXP organization with at least one active BlueXP Connector that connects to on-premises ONTAP clusters. Refer to the *Initial Preview setup process* below. 
//* A BlueXP organization with at least one active BlueXP Connector that connects to on-premises ONTAP clusters or to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS or Azure.


* At least one BlueXP working environment with a NetApp on-premises ONTAP cluster.
//* At least one BlueXP working environment with a NetApp on-premises ONTAP cluster or Cloud Volume ONTAP in AWS or Azure (using NAS or CIFS protocols).

* A BlueXP Connector

** ONTAP or Cloud Volume ONTAP clusters with ONTAP OS version 9.8 or greater are supported. 

** If your on-premises ONTAP clusters or Cloud Volume ONTAP in AWS or in Azure cloud are not already onboarded in BlueXP, then you'll need a BlueXP Connector.

Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn how to configure a BlueXP Connector] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-checklist-cm.html[standard BlueXP requirements^].

** The Preview version requires the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS operating system for the Connector. 

//RHEL connector will be supported during GA.
 


//All source and working environments must be in the same BlueXP organization.

=== Set up BlueXP
The next step is to set up BlueXP and the BlueXP backup and recovery service. 

Review https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-checklist-cm.html[standard BlueXP requirements^].


=== Create a BlueXP Connector

You should reach out to your NetApp Product Team to try out or use this Preview. Then, when you use the BlueXP Connector, it will include the appropriate capabilities for the service. 

To create a Connector in BlueXP before using the service, refer to the BlueXP documentation that describes https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[how to create a BlueXP Connector^]. 




== In ONTAP 9.8 and later

An ONTAP One license must be enabled on the on-premises ONTAP instance.


//* To apply advanced protection configurations (such as enabling DataLock and others), BlueXP backup and recovery needs admin permissions on the ONTAP cluster. The ONTAP cluster should have been onboarded using ONTAP cluster admin user credentials only. 

//* If the ONTAP cluster is already onboarded in BlueXP using non-admin user credentials, then the non-admin user permissions must be updated with necessary permissions by logging into the ONTAP cluster, described on this page. 


== For backups to object storage

To use object storage as backup targets, you need an account with NetApp StorageGRID, AWS S3, or Microsoft Azure Blob and the appropriate access permissions configured. 

Refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/task-backup-onprem-to-azure.html[Backups to AWS, Azure, or S3^]. 

Refer to link://concept-start-setup.html[How to set up backup destinations].
