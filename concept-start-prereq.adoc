Get started with BlueXP backup and recovery by verifying the readiness of your operational environment, login, network access, and web browser.

To use BlueXP backup and recovery, you'll need these prerequisites.


== In BlueXP 


* A BlueXP user account with Organization Admin privileges for discovering resources.

* A BlueXP organization with at least one active BlueXP Connector connecting to on-premises ONTAP clusters or connecting to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS or in Azure. 

* The BlueXP Connector must have the `cloudmanager-ransomware-protection` container in an active state. 

* At least one BlueXP working environment with a NetApp on-premises ONTAP cluster or Cloud Volume ONTAP in AWS or Azure (using NAS or CIFS protocols).

** ONTAP or Cloud Volume ONTAP clusters with ONTAP OS version 9.11.1 or greater are supported. 

** If your on-premises ONTAP clusters or Cloud Volume ONTAP in AWS or in Azure cloud are not already onboarded in BlueXP, then you'll need a BlueXP Connector.

Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn how to configure a BlueXP Connector] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-checklist-cm.html[standard BlueXP requirements^].


//All source and working environments must be in the same BlueXP organization. 



== In ONTAP 9.11.1 and later

* An ONTAP One license is enabled on the on-premises ONTAP instance.


* A license for NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection, used by BlueXP ransomware protection, enabled on the on-premises ONTAP instance, depending on the version of ONTAP you are using. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview^].


* To apply protection configurations (such as enabling Autonomous Ransomware Protection and others), BlueXP ransomware protection needs admin permissions on the ONTAP cluster. The ONTAP cluster should have been onboarded using ONTAP cluster admin user credentials only. 

* If the ONTAP cluster is already onboarded in BlueXP using non-admin user credentials, then the non-admin user permissions must be updated with necessary permissions by logging into the ONTAP cluster, described on this page. 


== For data backups

* An account in NetApp StorageGRID, AWS S3, or Azure Blob for backup targets and the access permissions set. 
+
Refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions.html[AWS, Azure, or S3 permissions list^] for details. 



== Update non-admin user permissions in an ONTAP working environment

If you need to update non-admin user permissions for a particular working environment, complete these steps. 


.  Log in to BlueXP and look for the working environment that needs its ONTAP user permissions updated. 

. Double-click on the working environment to see details. 
. Click *View additional information* that shows the user name. 
. Log in to the ONTAP cluster CLI using the admin user. 
. Display the existing roles for that user. Enter:
