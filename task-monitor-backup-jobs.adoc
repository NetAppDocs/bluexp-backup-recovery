summary: You can monitor the status of backup and restore jobs that you have initiated in your working environments. This allows you to see the jobs that have completed successfully, those currently in progress, and those that have failed so you can diagnose and fix any problems. You can also configure notifications to be sent by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system.

You can monitor the status of backup and restore jobs that you have initiated in your working environments. This allows you to see the jobs that have completed successfully, those currently in progress, and those that have failed so you can diagnose and fix any problems. You can also configure notifications to be sent by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system.

== Use the Job Monitor to view backup and restore job status

You can view a list of all the backup and restore operations and their current status in the *Job Monitoring* tab. This includes operations from your Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-premises ONTAP, Applications, Virtual Machines, and Kubernetes systems. Each operation, or job, has a unique ID and a status. The status can be:

* Success
* In Progress
* Queued
* Warning
* Failed

Note that system-initiated jobs, such ongoing backup operations, are not reflected in the *Job Monitoring* tab -- only user-initiated jobs are displayed.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu, select *Protection > Backup and recovery*.

. Click the *Job Monitoring* tab.

This screenshot shows the default column/field headings. You can click image:button_plus_sign_round.png[] to show and hide column headings, or to add 2 additional headings for "User Name" and "Type".

If you are looking for specific jobs, you can:

* use the time selector at the top left of the page to view jobs for a certain period of time
* enter a part of the job name in the Search field
* click *View Jobs* for a certain Status, for example, under "Failed" to view only Failed jobs
* sort the results by using the filter in each column heading. For example, the filter for the "Workloads" column enables you to view jobs in the following catagories:
** Volumes (Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-prem ONTAP volumes)
** Applications
** Virtual Machines
** Kubernetes

Note that this page automatically refreshes every 15 minutes so that you'll always see the most recent job status results. You can click the image:button_refresh.png[Refresh button] button to update the page immediately.

=== Download Job Monitoring results as a report

If you want to download the contents of the main Job Monitoring page as a report after you've refined it, click the image:button_download.png[Download button] button. Cloud Backup generates a .CSV file that you can review and send to other groups as needed. The .CSV file includes up to 10,000 rows of data.

=== View job details

You can view details corresponding to a specific job by clicking the name of the job. You'll see all the sub-jobs that are running to complete the main job in the Job Details page.

== Use the Notification Center to review backup and restore alerts 

The Notification Center tracks the progress of backup and restore jobs that you've initiated so you can verify whether the operation was successful or not. You can display the notifications by clicking the (image:icon_bell.png[notification bell]) in the BlueXP menu bar. You can also configure BlueXP to send notifications by email as alerts so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system.

At this time, there are four events that will trigger email alerts:

* Cloud Backup activation failed on working environment
* Cloud Backup restore operation failed
* Adhoc (on-demand) volume backup failed
* Potential Ransomware attack detected on your system

By default, BlueXP Account Admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" alerts. All other users and recipients are configured, by default, not to receive any notification emails. Emails can be sent to any BlueXP users who are part of your NetApp Cloud Account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of backup and restore activity. 

You'll need to select the notification types "Critical" and "Error" to receive the Cloud Backup email alerts.
