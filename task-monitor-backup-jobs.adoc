You can monitor the status of backup and restore jobs that you have initiated in your working environments. You can see the jobs that have completed successfully, those currently in progress, and those that have failed so you can diagnose and fix problems. You can also configure notifications to be sent by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system.

== View backup and restore job status on the Job Monitor

You can view a list of all the backup and restore operations and their current status in the *Job Monitoring* tab. This includes operations from your Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-premises ONTAP, applications, virtual machines, and Kubernetes systems. Each operation, or job, has a unique ID and a status. 

The backup and restore status can be:

* Success
* In Progress
* Queued
* Warning
* Failed

NOTE: System-initiated jobs, such as ongoing backup operations, are not reflected in the *Job Monitoring* tab -- only user-initiated jobs are displayed.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu, select *Protection > Backup and recovery*.

. Select the *Job Monitoring* tab.

This screenshot shows the default column/field headings. 

. To show or hide column headings or to add 2 additional headings for "User Name" and "Type", select image:button_plus_sign_round.png[the plus sign button].

. To look for specific jobs, do any of the following:
+
* Use the time selector at the top left of the page to view jobs for a certain period of time.
* Enter a part of the job name in the Search field.
* Select *View Jobs* for a certain Status, for example, under "Failed" to view only Failed jobs.
* Sort the results by using the filter in each column heading. For example, the filter for the "Workloads" column enables you to view jobs in the following catagories:
** Volumes (Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP volumes)
** Applications
** Virtual Machines
** Kubernetes

This page refreshes every 15 minutes so that you'll always see the most recent job status results. You can select the image:button_refresh.png[Refresh] button to update the page immediately.

=== Download job monitoring results as a report

You can download the contents of the main Job Monitoring page as a report after you've refined it. 

. Select the image:button_download.png[Download] button.

Cloud Backup generates a .CSV file that you can review and send to other groups as needed. The .CSV file includes up to 10,000 rows of data.

=== View job details

You can view details corresponding to a specific job.

. Select the name of the job.

== Review backup and restore alerts in the BlueXP Notification Center

The BlueXP Notification Center tracks the progress of backup and restore jobs that you've initiated so you can verify whether the operation was successful or not. 

In addition to viewing the alerts in the BlueXP list of notifications, you can configure BlueXP to send notifications by email as alerts so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html[Learn more about the Notification Center and how to send alert emails for backup and restore jobs^].

The following events trigger email alerts:

//* Cloud Backup activation failed on working environment
//* Cloud Backup restore operation failed
//* Adhoc (on-demand) volume backup failed
//* Potential Ransomware attack detected on your system

By default, BlueXP Account Admins receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" alerts. All other users and recipients are configured, by default, not to receive any notification emails. Emails can be sent to any BlueXP users who are part of your NetApp Cloud Account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of backup and restore activity. 

To receive the Cloud Backup email alerts, you'll need to select the notification severity types "Critical" and "Error."
