summary: You can monitor the status of backup and restore jobs that you have initiated in your working environments. This allows you to see the jobs that have completed successfully, those currently in progress, and those that have failed so you can diagnose and fix any problems. You can also configure notifications to be sent by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system.

You can monitor the status of backup and restore jobs that you have initiated in your working environments. This allows you to see the jobs that have completed successfully, those currently in progress, and those that have failed so you can diagnose and fix any problems. You can also configure notifications to be sent by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system.

== Use the Job Monitor to view backup and restore job status

You can view a list of all the backup and restore operations and their current status in the *Job Monitoring* tab. This includes operations from your Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-premises ONTAP, Applications, Virtual Machines, and Kubernetes systems. Each operation, or job, has a unique ID and a status. The status can be:

* Success
* In Progress
* Queued
* Warning
* Failed

NOTE: System-initiated jobs, such ongoing backup operations, are not reflected in the *Job Monitoring* tab at this time -- only user-initiated jobs are displayed.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu, select *Protection > Backup and recovery*.

. Click the *Job Monitoring* tab.

This screenshot shows the default column/field headings. You can click image:button_plus_sign_round.png[the plus sign button] to show four additional columns for "Working Environment", "SVM", "User Name" and "Workloads".

=== Searching and filtering the list of jobs

By default, the Job Monitoring page shows jobs from the last 24 hours. You can sort the results by clicking each column heading to sort by Status, Start Time, Resource Name, and more. 

If you're looking for specific jobs, or a specific group of jobs, you can click the *Advanced Search & Filtering* area to open the Search panel. This panel enables you to perform a free text search for any resource; for example "volume 1" or "application 3". You can also filter the jobs list according to the items in the drop-down menus.

This screenshot show how you would search for all "Volume" "Backup" jobs for volumes named "Volume_1" in the "past week".

Most of the filters are self-explanatory. The filter for "Workloads" enables you to view jobs in the following catagories:

* Volumes (Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-prem ONTAP volumes)
* Applications
* Virtual Machines
* Kubernetes

You can search for data within a specific "SVM" only if you have first selected a Working Environment.

Note that this page automatically refreshes every 15 minutes so that you'll always see the most recent job status results. You can click the image:button_refresh.png[Refresh] button if you need to update the page immediately.

=== View job details

You can view details corresponding to a specific job by clicking the name of the job. You'll see all the sub-jobs that are running to complete the main job in the Job Details page.

=== Download Job Monitoring results as a report

If you want to download the contents of the main Job Monitoring page as a report after you've refined it, click the image:button_download.png[Download] button. Cloud Backup generates and downloads a .CSV file that you can review and send to other groups as needed. The .CSV file includes up to 10,000 rows of data.

== Use the Notification Center to review backup and restore alerts 

The Notification Center tracks the progress of backup and restore jobs that you've initiated so you can verify whether the operation was successful or not. You can display the notifications by clicking the (image:icon_bell.png[notification bell]) in the BlueXP menu bar. You can also configure BlueXP to send notifications by email as alerts so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system.

At this time, there are four backup and restore events that will trigger email alerts:

* Cloud Backup activation failed on a working environment
* Cloud Backup restore operation failed
* Adhoc (on-demand) volume backup failed
* Potential Ransomware attack detected on your system

By default, BlueXP Account Admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" alerts. All other users and recipients are configured, by default, not to receive any notification emails. Emails can be sent to any BlueXP users who are part of your NetApp Cloud Account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of backup and restore activity. 

You'll need to select the notification types "Critical" and "Error" to receive the Cloud Backup email alerts.
