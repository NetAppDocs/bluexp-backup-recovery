You can monitor the status of backup jobs that you initiated or are scheduled and restore jobs that you initiated. You can see the jobs that have completed, are in progress, or failed so you can diagnose and fix problems. Using the BlueXP Notification Center, you can enable notifications to be sent by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system. Using the BlueXP Timeline, you can see details of all actions initiated via the UI or API.  

== View backup and restore job status on the Job Monitor

You can view a list of all the backup and restore operations and their current status in the *Job Monitoring* tab. This includes operations from your Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-premises ONTAP, applications, virtual machines, and Kubernetes systems. Each operation, or job, has a unique ID and a status. 

The backup and restore status can be:

* Success
* In Progress
* Queued
* Warning
* Failed

Both user-initiated backup and restore operations initiated from the Cloud Backup UI and API, and system-initiated jobs such as ongoing scheduled backup operations, are available in the Job Monitoring tab. However, this is true only for Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems running ONTAP 9.13.0 or greater and on-premises ONTAP systems running ONTAP 9.13.1 or greater. When running earlier versions of ONTAP, only user-initiated jobs are displayed.

NOTE: If you've upgraded your ONTAP systems to 9.13.x and you don't see ongoing scheduled backup operations in the Job Monitor, then you'll need to restart the BlueXP backup and recovery service. link:reference-restart-backup.html[Learn how to restart BlueXP backup and recovery].

.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu, select *Protection > Backup and recovery*.

. Select the *Job Monitoring* tab.
+
image:screenshot_backup_job_monitor.png[A screenshot showing backup and restore jobs in the Job Monitoring dashboard.]
+
This screenshot shows the default column headings. 

. To show additional columns (Working Environment, SVM, User Name, Workloads, Policy, and Snapshot Label), select image:button_plus_sign_round.png[the plus sign button].

=== Search and filter the list of jobs

You can filter the operations on the Job Monitoring page using several filters, such as backup policy and Snapshot label. 

By default, the Job Monitoring page shows jobs from the last 24 hours. 

.Steps

. Select the *Job Monitoring* tab.
. To sort the results differently, select each column heading to sort by Status, Start Time, Resource Name, and more. 

. If you're looking for specific jobs, or a specific group of jobs, select the *Advanced Search & Filtering* area to open the Search panel. 
+
Use this panel to enter a free text search for any resource; for example "volume 1" or "application 3". You can also filter the jobs list according to the items in the drop-down menus.
+
image:screenshot_backup_job_monitor_filters.png[A screenshot of setting the filters to view only jobs that match the filter criteria]
+
This screenshot show how you would search for all "Volume" "Backup" jobs for volumes named "Volume_1" in the "past week".

+
Most of the filters are self-explanatory. The filter for "Workloads" enables you to view jobs in the following catagories:

* Volumes (Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-prem ONTAP volumes)
* Applications
* Virtual Machines
* Kubernetes

+
TIP: You can search for data within a specific "SVM" only if you have first selected a Working Environment.

. To update the page immediately, select the image:button_refresh.png[Refresh] button. Otherwise, this page refreshes every 15 minutes so that you'll always see the most recent job status results. 

=== View job details

You can view details corresponding to a specific completed job. You can export details for a particular job in a JSON format. 

You can view details such as backup job type (scheduled or on-demand), SnapMirror backup type (initial or periodic) start and end times, duration, amount of transferred data from working environment to object storage, average transfer rate, backup policy name, retention lock enabled, ransomware scan performed, backup source details, and backup target details. 

Restore jobs show details such as backup target provider (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, on-premises), S3 bucket name, SVM name, source volume name, destination volume, Snapshot label, recovered objects count, file names, file sizes, last modification date, and full file path. 


NOTE: Job details appear for ONTAP backup jobs (both ad-hoc and scheduled, with scheduled jobs appearing only for ONTAP 9.13.0 or later), and all restore jobs. Job details appear for in-progress and completed jobs.

.Steps 

. Select the *Job Monitoring* tab.
. Select the name of the job. 
. Select the Actions menu image:icon-action.png[Actions icon] and select *View Details*. 
+
image:screenshot_backup_job_monitor_details2.png[A screenshot showing backup job details]

. Expand each section to see details. 

=== Download Job Monitoring results as a report

You can download the contents of the main Job Monitoring page as a report after you've refined it. BlueXP backup and recovery generates and downloads a .CSV file that you can review and send to other groups as needed. The .CSV file includes up to 10,000 rows of data.

From the Job Monitoring Details information, you can download a JSON file containing details for a single job. 

.Steps

. Select the *Job Monitoring* tab.
. To download a CSV file for all jobs, select the image:button_download.png[Download] button and locate the file in your download directory. 
. To download a JSON file for a single job, select the Actions menu image:icon-action.png[Actions icon] for the job, select *Download JSON File*, and locate the file in your download directory.  

== Review backup lifecycle jobs

Monitoring of backup lifecycle flows helps you with audit completeness, accountability, and backup safety. To help you track the backup lifecycle, you might want to identify the expiration of all backup copies. 

A backup lifecycle job tracks all snapshot copies that are deleted or in the queue to be deleted. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13, you can look at all job types called "Backup Lifecycle" on the Job Monitoring page.

The "Backup Lifecycle" job type captures all snapshot deletion jobs initiated on a volume that is protected by BlueXP backup and recovery.  

.Steps

. Select the *Job Monitoring* tab.
. Select the *Advanced Search & Filtering* area to open the Search panel. 
. Select the job type of "Backup Lifecycle". 

== Review backup and restore alerts in the BlueXP Notification Center

The BlueXP Notification Center tracks the progress of backup and restore jobs that you've initiated so you can verify whether the operation was successful or not. 

In addition to viewing the alerts in the Notification Center, you can configure BlueXP to send certain types of notifications by email as alerts so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html[Learn more about the Notification Center and how to send alert emails for backup and restore jobs^].

The Notification Center displays numerous events, but only the following backup and restore events trigger email alerts:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="3a,1d"]
|===
| Event
| Severity level
| Ad-hoc volume backup failed | Error 
| Backup activation failed on working environment | Critical 
| Backup files were not created because Snapshot policy labels do not match | Critical
| Restore operation failed | Critical
| Potential ransomware attack detected on your system | Critical 
| Restore job completed, but with warnings | Warning 
| Scheduled job failure | Error 

|===

NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.0, all alerts appear for Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems. For systems with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.13.0 and on-premises ONTAP, only the alert related to "Restore job completed, but with warnings" appears. 

By default, BlueXP Account Admins receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" alerts. All other users and recipients are set up, by default, not to receive any notification emails. Emails can be sent to any BlueXP users who are part of your NetApp Cloud Account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of backup and restore activity. 

To receive the BlueXP backup and recovery email alerts, you'll need to select the notification severity types "Critical", "Warning", and "Error" in the Alerts and Notifications Settings page.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html[Learn how to send alert emails for backup and restore jobs^].

.Steps 

. Select the *Job Monitoring* tab.
. Display notifications by selecting the (image:icon_bell.png[notification bell]) in the BlueXP menu bar. 
. Review the notification. 

== Review operation activity in the BlueXP Timeline

You can view details of backup and restore operations for further investigation in the BlueXP Timeline. The BlueXP Timeline provides details of each event, whether user-initiated or system-initiated and shows actions initiated in the UI or via the API.
