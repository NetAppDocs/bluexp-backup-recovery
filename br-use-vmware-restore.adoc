Restore VMware workloads from snapshot copies, from a workload backup replicated to secondary storage, or from backups stored in object storage using BlueXP backup and recovery. You can restore a workload to the original working environment, to a different working environment that's using the same cloud account, or to an on-premises ONTAP system.
