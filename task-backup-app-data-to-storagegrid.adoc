Complete a few steps to back up the applications data from ONTAP to StorageGRID.

.Before you begin

When backing up data to StorageGRID, a Connector must be available on your premises. You will either need to install a new Connector or make sure that the currently selected Connector resides on-prem. The Connector can be installed in a site with or without internet access.

For information, see link:task-backup-onprem-private-cloud.html#creating-or-switching-connectors[Create Connectors for StorageGRID].

.Steps

. In BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the application and click *Activate Backup*.
. In the Assign Policy page, select the policy and click *Next*.
. Add the working environment.
+
Configure the cluster management LIF that you want BlueXP to discover. After adding the working environment for one of the applications, it can be reused for all the other applications residing on the same ONTAP cluster.
+
.. Select the SVM and click *Add Working Environment*.
.. In the Add Working Environment wizard:
... Specify the IP address of the cluster Management LIF.
... Specify the credentials of the ONTAP cluster user.
+
BlueXP backup and recovery for applications only support cluster admin.
.. Click *Add Working Environment*.
. Select *StorageGRID*.
.. Specify the FQDN of the StorageGRID Server and the port on which the StorageGRID server is running.
+
Enter the details in the format FQDN:PORT.
.. In the Access Key field, specify the key.
.. In the Secret Key field, specify the password.
.. Specify the IP space.
.. Specify the archival tier.
