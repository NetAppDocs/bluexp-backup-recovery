Complete a few steps to back up the applications data from ONTAP to StorageGRID.

*What you will need*

When backing up data to StorageGRID, a Connector must be available on your premises. You will either need to install a new Connector or make sure that the currently selected Connector resides on-prem. The Connector can be installed in a site with or without internet access.

For information, see link:task-backup-onprem-private-cloud.html#creating-or-switching-connectors[Create Connectors for StorageGRID].
