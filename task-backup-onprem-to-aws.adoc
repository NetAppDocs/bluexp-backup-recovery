[.lead]
Complete a few steps to get started backing up data from your on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon S3 storage.

Note that "on-premises ONTAP systems" includes FAS, AFF, and ONTAP Select systems.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps. Details for each step are provided in the following sections in this topic.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Identify the configuration method you'll use

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Choose whether you'll connect your on-premises ONTAP cluster directly to AWS S3 using a public S3 endpoint, or whether you'll use a VPN or AWS Direct Connect and route traffic through a private VPC Endpoint interface to AWS S3.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you already have a Connector deployed in your AWS VPC, then you're all set. If not, then you'll need to create a Connector in AWS in order to back up ONTAP data to AWS S3 storage. You'll also need to customize network settings for the Connector so that it can connect to AWS S3.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Prepare Amazon S3 as your backup target

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Set up permissions for the Connector to create and manage the S3 bucket, and to restore data using the Restore instance. And set up permissions for the on-premises ONTAP cluster so it can read and write data to the S3 bucket.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Optionally, you can set up your own custom-managed keys for data encryption instead of using the default Amazon S3 encryption keys. <<Prepare your AWS environment,See how to get your AWS S3 environment ready to receive ONTAP backups.>>

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Enable Cloud Backup on the system

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the working environment and click *Enable > Backup Volumes* next to the Backup & Restore service in the right-panel. Then follow the setup wizard to define the default backup policy and number of backups to retain, and select the volumes you want to back up.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
<<Enable Cloud Backup,See how to activate Cloud Backup on your volumes.>>

== Network diagrams for connection options

There are two connection methods you can use when configuring backups from on-premises ONTAP systems to AWS S3.

* Public connection - Directly connect the ONTAP system to AWS S3 using a public S3 endpoint.
* Private connection - Use a VPN or AWS Direct Connect and route traffic through a VPC Endpoint interface that uses a private IP address.

The following image shows the public connection method and the connections that you need to prepare between the components:

image:diagram_cloud_backup_onprem_aws.png[A diagram showing how Cloud Backup communicates with the volumes on the source systems and the destination storage where the backup files are located.]

The following image shows the private connection method and the connections that you need to prepare between the components:

image:diagram_cloud_backup_onprem_aws_vpc.png[A diagram showing how Cloud Backup communicates with the volumes on the source systems and the destination storage where the backup files are located.]

Note that when the Cloud Restore instance is deployed in the cloud, it is located in the same subnet as the Connector.

== Prepare your Connector

The Cloud Manager Connector is the main software for Cloud Manager functionality. A Connector is required to back up and restore your ONTAP data.

=== Creating or switching Connectors

If you already have a Connector deployed in your AWS VPC then you're all set. If not, then you'll need to create a new Connector in AWS in order to back up ONTAP data to AWS S3 storage. You can't use a Connector that's deployed on-premises, or that's deployed in another cloud provider.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Connectors^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Create a Connector in AWS^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html[Switch between Connectors^]

=== Connector networking requirements

* Ensure that the network where the Connector is installed enables the following connections:
+
** An HTTPS connection over port 443 to the Cloud Backup service
** An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your S3 object storage
** An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your ONTAP cluster management LIF

* (Optional) Enable a VPC Endpoint interface to S3. This is needed if you have a Direct Connect or VPN connection from your ONTAP cluster to the VPC and you want communication between the Connector and S3 to stay in your AWS internal network. <<Set up a VPC endpoint interface (optional),See how to set up a VPC endpoint interface.>>

== Prepare your ONTAP cluster

=== Discover your ONTAP cluster in Cloud Manager

You need to discover your on-premises ONTAP cluster in Cloud Manager before you can start backing up volume data. You'll need to know the cluster management IP address and the password for the admin user account to add the cluster.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[Learn how to discover a cluster^].

=== ONTAP requirements

* ONTAP 9.7P5 and later.
* A SnapMirror license (included as part of the Premium Bundle or Data Protection Bundle).
+
*Note:* The "Hybrid Cloud Bundle" is not required when using Cloud Backup.
+
See how to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[manage your cluster licenses^].
*	Time and time zone are set correctly.
+
See how to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-cluster-time-concept.html[configure your cluster time^].

=== Cluster networking requirements

* The cluster requires an inbound HTTPS connection from the Connector to the cluster management LIF.
* An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to back up. These intercluster LIFs must be able to access the object store.
+
The cluster initiates an outbound HTTPS connection over port 443 from the intercluster LIFs to Amazon S3 storage for backup and restore operations. ONTAP reads and writes data to and from object storage -- the object storage never initiates, it just responds.
* The intercluster LIFs must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/standard_properties_of_ipspaces.html[Learn more about IPspaces^].
+
When you set up Cloud Backup, you are prompted for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that these LIFs are associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created.
+
If you use are using a different IPspace than "Default", then you might need to create a static route to get access to the object storage.
*	DNS servers must have been configured for the storage VM where the volumes are located. See how to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/configure_dns_services_auto.html[configure DNS services for the SVM^].
* Update firewall rules, if necessary, to allow Cloud Backup connections from ONTAP to object storage through port 443 and name resolution traffic from the storage VM to the DNS server over port 53 (TCP/UDP).
* (Optional) If you are using a Private VPC Interface Endpoint in AWS for the S3 connection, then in order for HTTPS/443 to be used you'll need to load the S3 endpoint certificate into the ONTAP cluster. <<Set up a VPC endpoint interface (optional),See how to set up a VPC endpoint interface and load the S3 certificate.>>

== Verify license requirements

* Before you can activate Cloud Backup for your cluster, you'll need to either subscribe to a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) Cloud Manager Marketplace offering from AWS, or purchase and activate a Cloud Backup BYOL license from NetApp. These licenses are for your account and can be used across multiple systems.

** For Cloud Backup PAYGO licensing, you'll need a subscription to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-oorxakq6lq7m4?sr=0-8&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa[AWS Cloud Manager Marketplace offering^] to use Cloud Backup. Billing for Cloud Backup is done through this subscription.
** For Cloud Backup BYOL licensing, you'll need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. link:task-licensing-cloud-backup.html#use-a-cloud-backup-byol-license[Learn how to manage your BYOL licenses].

* You need to have an AWS subscription for the object storage space where your backups will be located.
+
You can create backups from on-premises systems to Amazon S3 in all regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^]; including AWS GovCloud regions. You specify the region where backups will be stored when you set up the service.

== Prepare your AWS environment

=== Set up S3 permissions

You'll need to configure two sets of permissions:

* Permissions for the Connector to create and manage the S3 bucket, and to restore data using the Restore instance.
* Permissions for the on-premises ONTAP cluster so it can read and write data to the S3 bucket.

.Steps

. Confirm that the following S3 permissions (from the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[Cloud Manager policy^]) are part of the IAM role that provides the Connector with permissions.
+
[source,json]
{
          "Sid": "backupPolicy",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "s3:DeleteBucket",
              "s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration",
              "s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration",
              "s3:PutBucketTagging",
              "s3:ListBucketVersions",
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:DeleteObject",
              "s3:PutObject",
              "s3:ListBucket",
              "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
              "s3:GetBucketTagging",
              "s3:GetBucketLocation",
              "s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus",
              "s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock",
              "s3:GetBucketAcl",
              "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
              "s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock",
              "s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration",
              "athena:StartQueryExecution",
              "athena:GetQueryResults",
              "athena:GetQueryExecution",
              "glue:GetDatabase",
              "glue:GetTable",
              "glue:CreateTable",
              "glue:CreateDatabase",
              "glue:GetPartitions",
              "glue:BatchCreatePartition",
              "glue:BatchDeletePartition"
          ],
          "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::netapp-backup-*"
          ]
      },
+
If you deployed the Connector using version 3.9.15 or greater, these permissions should be part of the IAM role already. Otherwise you'll need to add the missing permissions. Specifically the "athena" and "glue" permissions, as they're required for Search & Restore. See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-edit.html[AWS Documentation: Editing IAM policies].

. Add the following EC2 permissions to the IAM role that provides the Connector with permissions so that it can start, stop, and terminate the Cloud Restore instance for Browse & Restore operations:
+
[source,json]
          "Action": [
              "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
              "ec2:StartInstances",
              "ec2:StopInstances",
              "ec2:TerminateInstances"
          ],

. When activating the service, the Backup wizard will prompt you to enter an access key and secret key. These credentials are passed to the ONTAP cluster so that ONTAP can back up and restore data to the S3 bucket. For that, you'll need to create an IAM user with the following permissions:
+
[source,json]
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
        {
           "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::netapp-backup-*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "backupPolicy"
        }
    ]
}
+
See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html[AWS Documentation: Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an IAM User^] for details.

=== Verify Cloud Restore internet access

If your virtual or physical network uses a proxy server for internet access, ensure that the Cloud Restore instance has outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints.

=== Set up Amazon S3 encryption (optional)

You can choose your own custom-managed keys for data encryption in the Backup activation wizard instead of using the default Amazon S3 encryption keys. In this case you'll need to have the encryption managed keys already set up. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-kms.html[See how to use your own keys^].

=== Set up a VPC endpoint interface (optional)

If you want to have a more secure connection over the public internet from your on-prem data center to the VPC, there's an option to select an AWS PrivateLink connection in the Backup activation wizard. It's required if you're connecting your on-premises system via VPN or AWS Direct Connect.

. Create an Interface endpoint configuration using the Amazon VPC console or the command line. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html[See details about using AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3^].

. Modify the security group configuration that's associated with the Cloud Manager Connector. You must change the policy to "Custom" (from "Full Access"), and you must <<Set up S3 permissions,add the S3 permissions from the backup policy>> as shown earlier.
+
image:screenshot_backup_aws_sec_group.png[A screenshot of the AWS security group associated with the Connector.]
+
If you are using port 80 (HTTP) for communication to the private endpoint, you are all set. You can enable Cloud Backup on the cluster now.
+
If you are using port 443 (HTTPS) for communication to the private endpoint, you must copy the certificate from the VPC S3 endpoint and add the certificate to your ONTAP cluster, as shown in the next 4 steps.
+
. Obtain the DNS name of the endpoint from the AWS Console.
+
image:screenshot_endpoint_dns_aws_console.png[A screenshot of the DNS name of the VPC endpoint from the AWS Console.]

.	Obtain the certificate from the VPC S3 endpoint. You do this by https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html#connect-to-the-linux-vm[logging into the VM that hosts the Cloud Manager Connector] and running the following command. When entering the DNS name of the endpoint, add “bucket” to the beginning, replacing the “*”:
+
[source,text]
[ec2-user@ip-10-160-4-68 ~]$ openssl s_client -connect bucket.vpce-0ff5c15df7e00fbab-yxs7lt8v.s3.us-west-2.vpce.amazonaws.com:443 -showcerts

.	From the output of this command, copy the data for the S3 certificate (all data between, and including, the BEGIN / END CERTIFICATE tags):
+
[source,text]
Certificate chain
0 s:/CN=s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
   i:/C=US/O=Amazon/OU=Server CA 1B/CN=Amazon
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIM6zCCC9OgAwIBAgIQA7MGJ4FaDBR8uL0KR3oltTANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBG
…
…
GqvbOz/oO2NWLLFCqI+xmkLcMiPrZy+/6Af+HH2mLCM4EsI2b+IpBmPkriWnnxo=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

.	Log into the ONTAP cluster CLI and apply the certificate you copied using the following command (substitute your own storage VM name):
+
[source,text]
cluster1::> security certificate install -vserver cluster1 -type server-ca
Please enter Certificate: Press <Enter> when done

== Enable Cloud Backup

Enable Cloud Backup at any time directly from the on-premises working environment.

.Steps

. From the Canvas, select the working environment and click *Enable > Backup Volumes* next to the Backup & Restore service in the right-panel.
+
image:screenshot_backup_onprem_enable.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup & Restore Enable button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. Select Amazon Web Services as your provider and click *Next*.

. Enter the provider details and click *Next*.

.. The AWS Account, the AWS Access Key, and the Secret Key used to store the backups.
+
The access key and secret key are for the IAM user you created to give the ONTAP cluster access to the S3 bucket.
.. The AWS region where the backups will be stored.
.. Whether you'll use the default Amazon S3 encryption keys, or choose your own customer-managed keys from your AWS account, to manage encryption of your data. (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-kms.html[See how to use your own keys]).
+
image:screenshot_backup_provider_settings_aws.png[A screenshot that shows the cloud provider details when backing up volumes from an ONTAP system to AWS S3.]

. If you don't have an existing Cloud Backup license for your account, you'll be prompted at this point to select the type of charging method that you want to use. You can subscribe to a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) Cloud Manager Marketplace offering from AWS (or if you have multiple subscriptions you'll need to select one), or purchase and activate a Cloud Backup BYOL license from NetApp. link:task-licensing-cloud-backup.html[Learn how to set up Cloud Backup licensing.]

. Enter the networking details and click *Next*.

.. The IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside. The intercluster LIFs for this IPspace must have outbound internet access.
.. Optionally, choose whether you'll use an AWS PrivateLink that you have previously configured. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html[See details about using AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3^].
+
image:screenshot_backup_onprem_aws_networking.png[A screenshot that shows the networking details when backing up volumes from an ONTAP system to AWS S3.]

. Enter the default backup policy details and click *Next*.

.. Define the backup schedule and choose the number of backups to retain. link:concept-ontap-backup-to-cloud.html#customizable-backup-schedule-and-retention-settings-per-cluster[See the list of existing policies you can choose^].
.. When using ONTAP 9.10.1 and greater, you can choose to tier backups to either S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage after a certain number of days for further cost optimization. link:reference-aws-backup-tiers.html[Learn more about using archival tiers].
+
image:screenshot_backup_policy_aws.png[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Backup settings where you can choose your schedule and backup retention.]

. Select the volumes that you want to back up using the default backup policy in the Select Volumes page. If you want to assign different backup policies to certain volumes, you can create additional policies and apply them to those volumes later.

+
* To back up all volumes, check the box in the title row (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[]).
* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).
+
image:screenshot_backup_select_volumes.png[A screenshot of selecting the volumes that will be backed up.]

+
If you want all volumes added in the future to have backup enabled, just leave the checkbox for "Automatically back up future volumes..." checked. If you disable this setting, you'll need to manually enable backups for future volumes.

. Click *Activate Backup* and Cloud Backup starts taking the initial backups of your volumes.

.Result

Cloud Backup starts taking the initial backups of each selected volume and the Volume Backup Dashboard is displayed so you can monitor the state of the backups.

.What's next?

You can link:task-manage-backups-ontap.html[start and stop backups for volumes or change the backup schedule^].
You can also link:task-restore-backups-ontap.html[restore entire volumes or individual files from a backup file^] to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in AWS, or to an on-premises ONTAP system.
