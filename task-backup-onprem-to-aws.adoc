Complete a few steps to get started backing up volume data from your on-premises ONTAP systems to a secondary storage system and to Amazon S3 cloud storage.

NOTE: "On-premises ONTAP systems" include FAS, AFF, and ONTAP Select systems.



== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps. Details for each step are provided in the following sections in this topic.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Identify the connection method you'll use

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Choose whether you'll connect your on-premises ONTAP cluster directly to AWS S3 over the public internet, or whether you'll use a VPN or AWS Direct Connect and route traffic through a private VPC Endpoint interface to AWS S3.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
<<Identify the connection method>>.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Prepare your BlueXP Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you already have a Connector deployed in your AWS VPC or on your premises, then you're all set. If not, then you'll need to create a BlueXP Connector to back up ONTAP data to AWS S3 storage. You'll also need to customize network settings for the Connector so that it can connect to AWS S3.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Prepare Amazon S3 as your backup target

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Set up permissions for the Connector to create and manage the S3 bucket. You'll also need to set up permissions for the on-premises ONTAP cluster so it can read and write data to the S3 bucket.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Optionally, you can set up your own custom-managed keys for data encryption instead of using the default Amazon S3 encryption keys. <<Prepare Amazon S3 as your backup target,Learn how to get your AWS S3 environment ready to receive ONTAP backups.>>

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the working environment and click *Enable > Backup Volumes* next to the Backup and recovery service in the right-panel. Then follow the setup wizard to select the replication and backup policies that you'll use and the volumes you want to back up.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
<<Activate backups on your ONTAP volumes>>.


 

== Identify the connection method

Choose which of the two connection methods you will use when configuring backups from on-premises ONTAP systems to AWS S3.

* *Public connection* - Directly connect the ONTAP system to AWS S3 using a public S3 endpoint.
* *Private connection* - Use a VPN or AWS Direct Connect and route traffic through a VPC Endpoint interface that uses a private IP address.

Optionally, you can connect to a secondary ONTAP system for replicated volumes using the public or private connection as well.

The following diagram shows the *public connection* method and the connections that you need to prepare between the components. You can use a Connector that you've installed on your premises, or a Connector that you've deployed in the AWS VPC.

image:diagram_cloud_backup_onprem_aws_public.png[A diagram showing how BlueXP backup and recovery communicates over a public connection with the volumes on the cluster and the AWS S3 storage where the backup files are located.]

The following diagram shows the *private connection* method and the connections that you need to prepare between the components. You can use a Connector that you've installed on your premises, or a Connector that you've deployed in the AWS VPC.

image:diagram_cloud_backup_onprem_aws_private.png[A diagram showing how BlueXP backup and recovery communicates over a private connection with the volumes on the cluster and the AWS S3 storage where the backup files are located.]

== Prepare your BlueXP Connector

The BlueXP Connector is the main software for BlueXP functionality. A Connector is required to back up and restore your ONTAP data.

=== Create or switch Connectors

If you already have a Connector deployed in your AWS VPC or on your premises, then you're all set. 

If not, then you'll need to create a Connector in one of those locations to back up ONTAP data to AWS S3 storage. You can't use a Connector that's deployed in another cloud provider.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Connectors^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-aws.html[Install a Connector in AWS^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-on-prem.html[Install a Connector in your premises^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-install-restricted-mode.html[Install a Connector in an AWS GovCloud region^]
+
BlueXP backup and recovery is supported in GovCloud regions when the Connector is deployed in the cloud - not when it's installed in your premises. Additionally, you must deploy the Connector from the AWS Marketplace. You can't deploy the Connector in a Government region from the BlueXP SaaS website.

=== Prepare Connector networking requirements
Ensure that the following networking requirements are met:

* Ensure that the network where the Connector is installed enables the following connections:
+
** An HTTPS connection over port 443 to the BlueXP backup and recovery service and to your S3 object storage (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-set-up-networking-aws.html#endpoints-contacted-for-day-to-day-operations[see the list of endpoints^])
** An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your ONTAP cluster management LIF
** Additional inbound and outbound security group rules are required for AWS and AWS GovCloud deployments. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-ports-aws.html[Rules for the Connector in AWS^] for details.

* link:task-backup-onprem-to-aws.html#set-up-s3-permissions[Ensure that the Connector has permissions to manage the S3 bucket].

* If you have a Direct Connect or VPN connection from your ONTAP cluster to the VPC, and you want communication between the Connector and S3 to stay in your AWS internal network (a *private* connection), you'll need to enable a VPC Endpoint interface to S3. <<Configure your system for a private connection using a VPC endpoint interface,See how to set up a VPC endpoint interface.>>



== Verify license requirements
You'll need to verify license requirements for both AWS and BlueXP: 

* Before you can activate BlueXP backup and recovery for your cluster, you'll need to either subscribe to a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) BlueXP Marketplace offering from AWS, or purchase and activate a BlueXP backup and recovery BYOL license from NetApp. These licenses are for your account and can be used across multiple systems.

** For BlueXP backup and recovery PAYGO licensing, you'll need a subscription to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-oorxakq6lq7m4?sr=0-8&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa[NetApp BlueXP offering from the AWS Marketplace^]. Billing for BlueXP backup and recovery is done through this subscription.
** For BlueXP backup and recovery BYOL licensing, you'll need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. link:task-licensing-cloud-backup.html#use-a-bluexp-backup-and-recovery-byol-license[Learn how to manage your BYOL licenses].

* You need to have an AWS subscription for the object storage space where your backups will be located.


*Supported regions* 

You can create backups from on-premises systems to Amazon S3 in all regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^]; including AWS GovCloud regions. You specify the region where backups will be stored when you set up the service.



== Prepare your ONTAP clusters

// This section uses an include along with the 2 subsections of "Discover your ONTAP cluster in BlueXP" and "Verify ONTAP system requirements"

// === Discover your ONTAP systems in BlueXP
// FROM INCLUDE

// FROM INCLUDE



=== Verify ONTAP networking requirements for backing up data to object storage

You must configure the following requirements on the system that connects to object storage. 

* For a fan-out backup architecture, configure the following settings on the _source_ system. 
* For a cascaded backup architecture, configure the following settings on the _secondary_ system.

The following ONTAP cluster networking requirements are needed: 

* The cluster requires an inbound HTTPS connection from the Connector to the cluster management LIF.
* An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to back up. These intercluster LIFs must be able to access the object store.
+
The cluster initiates an outbound HTTPS connection over port 443 from the intercluster LIFs to Amazon S3 storage for backup and restore operations. ONTAP reads and writes data to and from object storage -- the object storage never initiates, it just responds.
* The intercluster LIFs must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/standard_properties_of_ipspaces.html[Learn more about IPspaces^].
+
When you set up BlueXP backup and recovery, you are prompted for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that these LIFs are associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created.
+
If you use are using a different IPspace than "Default", then you might need to create a static route to get access to the object storage.
+
All intercluster LIFs within the IPspace must have access to the object store. If you can't configure this for the current IPspace, then you'll need to create a dedicated IPspace where all intercluster LIFs have access to the object store.
* DNS servers must have been configured for the storage VM where the volumes are located. See how to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/configure_dns_services_auto.html[configure DNS services for the SVM^].
* Update firewall rules, if necessary, to allow BlueXP backup and recovery connections from ONTAP to object storage through port 443 and name resolution traffic from the storage VM to the DNS server over port 53 (TCP/UDP).
* If you are using a Private VPC Interface Endpoint in AWS for the S3 connection, then in order for HTTPS/443 to be used, you'll need to load the S3 endpoint certificate into the ONTAP cluster. <<Configure your system for a private connection using a VPC endpoint interface,See how to set up a VPC endpoint interface and load the S3 certificate.>>
* link:task-backup-onprem-to-aws.html#set-up-s3-permissions[Ensure that your ONTAP cluster has permissions to access the S3 bucket].


===  Verify ONTAP networking requirements for replicating volumes

//This section uses an Include for all providers. It includes "Cloud Volumes ONTAP networking requirements", and "On-premises ONTAP networking requirements"   

include::../_include/backup-onprem-prepare-source-destination-systems-for-repl.adoc[]




== Prepare Amazon S3 as your backup target
Preparing Amazon S3 as your backup target involves the following steps: 

* Set up S3 permissions.
* (Optional) Create your own S3 buckets. (The service will create buckets for you if you want.)
* (Optional) Set up customer-managed AWS keys for data encryption.
* (Optional) Configure your system for a private connection using a VPC endpoint interface. 

=== Set up S3 permissions

You'll need to configure two sets of permissions:

* Permissions for the Connector to create and manage the S3 bucket.
* Permissions for the on-premises ONTAP cluster so it can read and write data to the S3 bucket.


.Steps


. Confirm that the following S3 permissions (from the latest https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions-aws.html[BlueXP policy^]) are part of the IAM role that provides the Connector with permissions. If they are not, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-edit.html[AWS Documentation: Editing IAM policies].

NOTE: When creating backups in AWS China regions, you need to change the AWS Resource Name "arn" under all _Resource_ sections in the IAM policies from "aws" to "aws-cn"; for example `arn:aws-cn:s3:::netapp-backup-*`.

. When you activate the service, the Backup wizard will prompt you to enter an access key and secret key. These credentials are passed to the ONTAP cluster so that ONTAP can back up and restore data to the S3 bucket. For that, you'll need to create an IAM user with the following permissions.

=== Create your own buckets
By default, the service creates buckets for you. Or, if you want to use your own buckets, you can create them before you start the backup activation wizard and then select those buckets in the wizard. 

If you create your own buckets, you should use a bucket name of “netapp-backup”.  If you need to use a custom name, edit the “ontapcloud-instance-policy-netapp-backup" IAMRole for the existing CVOs and add the following list to the  S3 permissions. You need to include “Resource”: “arn:aws:s3:::*” and assign all the necessary permissions that need to be associated with the bucket.

=== Set up customer-managed AWS keys for data encryption

If you want to use the default Amazon S3 encryption keys to encrypt the data passed between your on-prem cluster and the S3 bucket, then you are all set because the default installation uses that type of encryption.

If instead you want to use your own customer-managed keys for data encryption rather than using the default keys, then you'll need to have the encryption managed keys already set up before you start the BlueXP backup and recovery wizard. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-kms.html[Refer to how to use your own keys^].

=== Configure your system for a private connection using a VPC endpoint interface

If you want to use a standard public internet connection, then all the permissions are set by the Connector and there is nothing else you need to do. This type of connection is shown in the link:task-backup-onprem-to-aws.html#network-diagrams-for-connection-options[first diagram].

If you want to have a more secure connection over the internet from your on-prem data center to the VPC, there's an option to select an AWS PrivateLink connection in the Backup activation wizard. It's required if you plan to use a VPN or AWS Direct Connect to connect your on-premises system through a VPC Endpoint interface that uses a private IP address. This type of connection is shown in the link:task-backup-onprem-to-aws.html#network-diagrams-for-connection-options[second diagram].

.Steps

. Create an Interface endpoint configuration using the Amazon VPC console or the command line. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html[Refer to details about using AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3^].

. Modify the security group configuration that's associated with the BlueXP Connector. You must change the policy to "Custom" (from "Full Access"), and you must <<Set up S3 permissions,add the S3 permissions from the backup policy>> as shown earlier.
+
image:screenshot_backup_aws_sec_group.png[A screenshot of the AWS security group associated with the Connector.]
+
If you're using port 80 (HTTP) for communication to the private endpoint, you're all set. You can enable BlueXP backup and recovery on the cluster now.
+
If you're using port 443 (HTTPS) for communication to the private endpoint, you must copy the certificate from the VPC S3 endpoint and add it to your ONTAP cluster, as shown in the next 4 steps.
+
. Obtain the DNS name of the endpoint from the AWS Console.
+
image:screenshot_endpoint_dns_aws_console.png[A screenshot of the DNS name of the VPC endpoint from the AWS Console.]

. Obtain the certificate from the VPC S3 endpoint. You do this by https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html#connect-to-the-linux-vm[logging into the VM that hosts the BlueXP Connector^] and running the following command. When entering the DNS name of the endpoint, add “bucket” to the beginning, replacing the “*”:
+
[source,text]
[ec2-user@ip-10-160-4-68 ~]$ openssl s_client -connect bucket.vpce-0ff5c15df7e00fbab-yxs7lt8v.s3.us-west-2.vpce.amazonaws.com:443 -showcerts

.	From the output of this command, copy the data for the S3 certificate (all data between, and including, the BEGIN / END CERTIFICATE tags):
+
[source,text]
Certificate chain
0 s:/CN=s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
   i:/C=US/O=Amazon/OU=Server CA 1B/CN=Amazon
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

-----END CERTIFICATE-----

.	Log into the ONTAP cluster CLI and apply the certificate you copied using the following command (substitute your own storage VM name):
+
[source,text]
cluster1::> security certificate install -vserver cluster1 -type server-ca
Please enter Certificate: Press <Enter> when done



== Activate backups on your ONTAP volumes

Activate backups at any time directly from your on-premises working environment.

A wizard takes you through the following major steps: 

* <<Select the volumes that you want to back up>>
* <<Define the backup strategy>>
* <<Review your selections>> 

You can also <<Show the API commands>> at the review step, so you can copy the code to automate backup activation for future working environments.  

=== Start the wizard 

.Steps 

. Access the Activate backup and recovery wizard using one of the following ways: 
* From the BlueXP canvas, select the working environment and select *Enable > Backup Volumes* next to the Backup and recovery service in the right-panel.
+
If the Amazon S3 destination for your backups exists as a working environment on the Canvas, you can drag the ONTAP cluster onto the Amazon S3 object storage. 
* Select *Volumes* in the Backup and recovery bar. From the Volumes tab, select the *Actions (...)* option and select *Activate Backup* for a single volume (that does not already have replication or backup to object storage already enabled). 

+ 
The Introduction page of the wizard shows the protection options including local Snapshots, replication, and backups. If you did the second option in this step, the Define Backup Strategy page appears with one volume selected. 


. Continue with the following options: 

* If you already have a BlueXP Connector, you're all set. Just select *Next*. 
* If you don't already have a BlueXP Connector, the *Add a Connector* option appears. Refer to <<Prepare your BlueXP Connector>>. 


=== Select the volumes that you want to back up

Choose the volumes you want to protect. You can choose to protect FlexVol or FlexGroup volumes; however, you cannot select a mix of these for the working environment you chose to protect.  

[NOTE]: 
====

* You can activate a backup only on a single FlexGroup volume at a time. 

* The volumes you select must have the same SnapLock setting as well. All volumes must have SnapLock Enterprise enabled or have SnapLock disabled. (Volumes with SnapLock Compliance mode aren’t currently supported.) You can’t select a combination of locked and unlocked volumes.
====

A protected volume is one that has one or more of the following: Snapshot policy, replication policy, backup to object policy. 

NOTE: If the volumes you choose have different Snapshot and replication policies than the policies you select later, the existing policies will be overwritten. 

.Steps 
. In the Select Volumes page, select the volume or volumes you want to protect. 
+
* Optionally, filter the rows to show only volumes with certain volume types, styles and more to make the selection easier. 
* After you select the first volume, then you can select all FlexVol volumes. To back up all existing FlexVol volumes and any FlexVol volumes added in the future, check one volume first and then check the box in the title row. (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[]).
+
TIP: We recommend this option so that all your volumes will be backed up and you'll never have to remember to enable backups for new volumes.

* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).


. Select *Next*.


=== Define the backup strategy 

Defining the backup strategy involves setting the following options: 

* Whether you want one or all of the backup options: local Snapshots, replication, and backup to object storage
* Architecture
* Local Snapshot policy
* Replication target and policy
+
NOTE: If the volumes you choose have different Snapshot and replication policies than the policies you select in this step, the existing policies will be overwritten. 

* Backup to object storage information (provider, encryption, networking, backup policy, and export options). 


.Steps 

. In the Define backup strategy page, choose one or all of the following. All three are selected by default: 
+
* *Local Snapshots*: If you are performing replication or back up to object storage, local Snapshots must be created. 
* *Replication*: Creates replicated volumes on another ONTAP storage system.  
* *Backup*: Backs up volumes to object storage  

. *Architecture*: If you chose replication and backup, choose one of the following flows of information: 
* *Cascading*: Information flows from the source to the secondary to object storage and from the secondary to object storage. 
* *Fan out*: Information flows from the source to the secondary _and_ from the source to object storage. 
+ 
For details about these architectures, refer to link:concept-protection-journey.html[Plan your protection journey]. 

. *Local Snapshot*: Choose an existing Snapshot policy. 
+
TIP: If you want to create a custom policy, you can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI `snapmirror policy create` command. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9131/snapmirror-policy-create.html[ONTAP CLI for `snapmirror policy`^].


. *Replication*: Set the following options: 
+
* *Replication target*: Select the destination working environment and SVM. Optionally, select the destination, aggregates and prefix or suffix that will be added to the replicated volume name. 
* *Replication policy*: Choose an existing replication policy. 

. *Back up to Object*: If you selected *Backup*, set the following options: 
+
* *Provider*: Select *Amazon Web Services*. 
* *Provider settings*: Enter the provider details and AWS region where the backups will be stored.

+
The access key and secret key are for the IAM user you created to give the ONTAP cluster access to the S3 bucket.


* *Bucket*: Either choose an existing S3 bucket or create a new one. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-s3-storage/task-add-s3-bucket.html[Add S3 buckets^].

* *Encryption key*: If you created a new S3 bucket, enter encryption key information given to you from the provider. Choose whether you'll use the default Amazon S3 encryption keys, or choose your own customer-managed keys from your AWS account, to manage encryption of your data. 

+ 
NOTE: If you chose an existing bucket, encryption information is already available, so you don't need to enter it now. 

* *Networking*: Choose the IPspace, and whether you'll be using a Private Endpoint. Private Endpoint is disabled by default.

.. The IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside. The intercluster LIFs for this IPspace must have outbound internet access.
.. Optionally, choose whether you'll use an AWS PrivateLink that you have previously configured. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html[See details about using AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3^].

* *Backup policy*: Select an existing backup policy. 
+
TIP: If you want to create a custom policy, you can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI `snapmirror policy create` command. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9131/snapmirror-policy-create.html[ONTAP CLI for `snapmirror policy`^].

* *Export existing Snapshot copies to object storage as backup copies*: If there are any local Snapshot copies for read/write volumes in this working environment that match the backup schedule label you just selected for this working environment (for example, daily, weekly, etc.), this additional prompt is displayed. Check this box to have all historic Snapshots copied to object storage as backup files to ensure the most complete protection for your volumes.

. Select *Next*. 

//.. Enter the name for the default policy. You don't need to change the name.
//.. Define the backup schedule and choose the number of backups to retain. link:concept-ontap-backup-to-cloud.html#customizable-backup-schedule-and-retention-settings[See the list of existing policies you can choose^].

//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.11.1 and greater, you can choose to protect your backups from deletion and ransomware attacks by configuring one of the _DataLock and Ransomware Protection_ settings. _DataLock_ protects your backup files from being modified or deleted, and _Ransomware protection_ scans your backup files to look for evidence of a ransomware attack in your backup files. link:concept-cloud-backup-policies.html#datalock-and-ransomware-protection[Learn more about the available DataLock settings^].
//+
//NOTE: If you plan to use DataLock, you must enable it in your first policy when activating BlueXP backup and recovery. You might want to protect your backups from deletion by using _DataLock_.

//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.10.1 and greater, you can choose to tier backups to either S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage after a certain number of days for further cost optimization. link:reference-aws-backup-tiers.html[Learn more about using archival tiers^].




=== Review your selections 
This is the chance to review your selections and make adjustments, if necessary. 

.Steps 

. In the Review page, review your selections. 
. Optionally check the box to *Automatically synchronize the Snapshot policy labels with the replication and backup policy labels*. This creates Snapshots with a label that matches the labels in the replication and backup policies.  
. Select *Activate Backup*. 


.Result 
BlueXP backup and recovery starts taking the initial backups of your volumes. The baseline transfer of the replicated volume and the backup file includes a full copy of the source data. Subsequent transfers contain differential copies of the source data contained in Snapshot copies.

A replicated volume is created in the destination cluster that will be synchronized with the source volume. 

The S3 bucket is created in the service account indicated by the S3 access key and secret key you entered, and the backup files are stored there. The Volume Backup Dashboard is displayed so you can monitor the state of the backups.

You can also monitor the status of backup and restore jobs using the link:task-monitor-backup-jobs.html[Job Monitoring panel^].


=== Show the API commands 
You might want to display and optionally copy the API commands used in the Activate backup and recovery wizard. You might want to do this to automate backup activation in future working environments. 

.Steps 

. From the Activate backup and recovery wizard, select *View API request*. 
. To copy the commands to the clipboard, select the *Copy* icon.
