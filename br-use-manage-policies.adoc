Using BlueXP backup and recovery, you edit or delete policies.  



== Edit policies 

You can edit backup architecture, backup frequency, retention policy, and other settings for a policy.

You can add another protection level when you edit a policy, but you cannot remove a protection level. For example, if the policy is only protecting local snapshots, you can add replication to secondary storage or backups to object storage. If you have local snapshots and replication, you can add object storage. However, if you have local snapshots, replication, and object storage, you cannot remove one of these levels. 

If you are editing a policy that backs up to object storage, you can enable archival.   

.Steps
. In BlueXP backup and recovery, select *Policies*.
. Select the policy that you want to edit.
. Select the *Actions* image:icon-action.png["Actions icon"] icon, and select *Edit*.
