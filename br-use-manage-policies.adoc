summary: You can back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID, ensuring that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.
