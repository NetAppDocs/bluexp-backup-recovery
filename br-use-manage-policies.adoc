Using BlueXP backup and recovery, you edit or delete policies. Policies govern the backup frequency, the time the backup is taken, and the number of backup files that are retained. 

//This used to be the topic for Manage backup policies for ONTAP volumes. Recasting this for MS SQL Server apps and other new available workloads. (2025 summer changes)

If you import resources from SnapCenter, you might encounter some differences policies used in SnapCenter and those used in BlueXP backup and recovery. See link:reference-policy-differences-snapcenter.html[Policy differences between SnapCenter and BlueXP backup and recovery].

.Required BlueXP role

Organization admin or Folder or project admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

== View policies 

. In BlueXP, got to *Protection* > *Backup and recovery*.
. Select the *Policies* tab.
. Review these policy details:

* *Workload*: Examples include Oracle, SQL Server, Kubernetes, VMware, and Volumes. 
* *Backup type*: Examples include Full backup and Incremental backup.
* *Architecture*: Examples include local snapshot, fan-out, cascading, disk to disk, and disk to object store. 
* *Resources protected*: Shows how many resources out of the total resources on that workload are protected.
* *Ransomware protection*: Shows if the policy includes snapshot locking on the local snapshot, snapshot locking on secondary storage, or DataLock locking on object storage. 

== Edit a policy

You can edit backup architecture, backup frequency, retention policy, and other settings for a policy.

You can add another protection level when you edit a policy, but you cannot remove a protection level. For example, if the policy is only protecting local snapshots, you can add replication to secondary storage or backups to object storage. If you have local snapshots and replication, you can add object storage. However, if you have local snapshots, replication, and object storage, you cannot remove one of these levels. 

If you are editing a policy that backs up to object storage, you can enable archival.
