You should assign either a pre-canned policy or the policy that you created and then take a backup.

== Create policy for protecting Oracle database

You can create policies if you do not want to edit the pre-canned policies.

*Steps*

. In the Applications page, from the Settings drop-down list, select *Policies*.
. Click *Create policy*.
. Specify a policy name.
. (Optional) Edit the format of the backup name.
. Specify the schedule and retention details.
. (Optional) Enter the post-script path, arguments, and timeout value for post-script that will be executed after the successful backup to copy the snapshot to secondary storage.
+
You should keep the post-scripts in the path _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/scripts_.
+
The supported environment variables are:
+
|===
| Environmental Variable | Description

a|
SC_ORACLE_SID
a|
Specifies the SID of the Oracle database.
a|
SC_HOST
a|
Specifies the hostname of the database
a|
SC_BACKUP_NAME
a|
Specifies the name of the backup. The data backup name and the log backup name are concatenated using delimiters.
a|
SC_BACKUP_POLICY_NAME
a|
Specifies the name of the policy used to create the backup.
a|
SC_PRIMARY_DATA_VOLUME_FULL_PATH
a|
Specifies the data volume paths concatenated using "," as delimiter.
For ANF volumes, the information is concatenated using "/"
_/{anfaccount}/{subscription_id}/{resource_group}/{capacity_pool}/{volumename}_
a|
SC_PRIMARY_ARCHIVELOGS_VOLUME_FULL_PATH
a|
Specifies the archive log volume paths concatenated using "," as delimiter.
For ANF volumes, the information in concatenated using "/"
_/{anfaccount}/{subscription_id}/{resource_group}/{capacity_pool}/{volumename}_
|===

. Click *Create*.

== Create a backup of the Oracle Database

You can either assign a pre-canned policy or create a policy and then assign it to the database. Once the policy is assigned, the backups are created as per the schedule defined in the policy.

NOTE: For Oracle, when creating ASM diskgroups, ensure that there are no common volumes across diskgroups. Each diskgroup needs to have dedicated volumes.

*Steps*

. In the Applications page, if the database is not protected using any policy, click *Assign Policy*.
+
If the database is protected using one or more policies, you can assign more policies by clicking image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] > *Assign Policy*.
. Select the policy and click *Assign*.
+
The backups will be created as per the schedule defined in the policy.
+
NOTE: The service account (_SnapCenter-account-<account_id>_) is used for running the scheduled backup operations.

== Create on-demand backup of the Oracle database

After assigning the policy, you can create an on-demand backup of the application.

*Steps*

. In the Applications page, click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the application and click *On-Demand Backup*.
. If multiple policies are assigned to the application, select the policy, retention value, and then click *Create Backup*.

*Find more information*

After restoring a large database (250 GB or more), if you perform a full online backup on the same database the operation might fail with the following error:

`failed with status code 500, error {\"error\":{\"code\":\"app_internal_error\",\"message\":\"Failed to create snapshot. Reason: Snapshot operation not allowed due to clones backed by snapshots. Try again after sometime.`

For information on how to fix this issue, refer to: https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/Snapshot_operation_not_allowed_due_to_clones_backed_by_snapshots[Snapshot operation not allowed due to clones backed by snapshots].

== Limitations

* Does not support backing up of Oracle database residing on recursive mount points
* Does not support consistency group Snapshots for Oracle databases residing on Multiple ASM disk groups with overlap of FSx volumes
* If your Oracle databases are configured on ASM, ensure your SVM names are unique across the FSx systems. If you have same SVM name across FSx systems, back up of Oracle databases residing on those SVMs are not supported.
