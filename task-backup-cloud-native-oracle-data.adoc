Before creating a backup of the Oracle database, you should discover the databases, configure database credentials, and assign either a pre-canned policy or the policy that you created.

== Discover Oracle databases

You should discover the databases on the host to assign policies and create backups.

*What you will need*

* You should have created the working environment and the Connector.
* Ensure that the Connector has connectivity to the working environment and Oracle database hosts.
* Ensure that the BlueXP user has the “Account Admin” role.
* You should have deployed the SnapCenter Plug-in for Oracle. link:task-deploy-snapcenter-plugin-for-oracle.html[Learn more].

*Steps*

. In the BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
. Click Discover Applications.
. Select *Cloud Native* and click *Next*.
+
A service account with _SnapCenter System_ role is created to perform scheduled data protection operations for all the users in this account.
+
* Click *Account* > *Manage Account* > *Members* to view the service account.
+
NOTE: The service account (_SnapCenter-account-<accountid>_) is used for running the scheduled backup operations. You should never delete the service account.

. In the Specify Host Details page, enter the details of the Oracle database host, select the check box to confirm that the plug-in is installed on the host, and click *Discover*.
+
* Displays all the databases on the host. If OS authentication is disabled for the database, you should configure database authentication by clicking *Configure*. For more information, refer to <<Configure Oracle database credentials>>.
+
* Click *Manage Application*, select *Add* to add a new host, *Refresh* to discover new databases, or *Remove* to remove a database host.
+
* Click *Settings* and select *Policies* to view the pre-canned policies. Review the pre-canned policies and if you want you can either edit them to meet your requirement or create a new policy.

== Configure Oracle database credentials

You should configure credentials that are used to perform data protection operations on Oracle databases.

*Steps*

. If OS authentication is disabled for the database, you should configure database authentication by clicking *Configure*.
. Specify the username, password, and the port details either in the Database Settings or ASM Settings section.
+
The Oracle user should have sysdba privileges and ASM user should have sysasm privileges.
. Click *Configure*.

== Create policy for protecting Oracle database

You can create policies if you do not want to edit the pre-canned policies.

*Steps*

. In the Applications page, from the Settings drop-down list, select *Policies*.
. Click *Create policy*.
. Specify a policy name.
. (Optional) Edit the format of the backup name.
. Specify the schedule and retention details.
. Click *Create*.

== Create a backup of the Oracle Database

You can either assign a pre-canned policy or create a policy and then assign it to the database. Once the policy is assigned, the backups are created as per the schedule defined in the policy.

NOTE: For Oracle, when creating ASM diskgroups, ensure that there are no common volumes across diskgroups. Each diskgroup needs to have dedicated volumes.

*Steps*

. In the Applications page, if the database is not protected using any policy, click *Assign Policy*.
+
If the database is protected using one or more policies, you can assign more policies by clicking image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] > *Assign Policy*.
. Select the policy and click *Assign*.
+
The backups will be created as per the schedule defined in the policy.
+
NOTE: The service account (_SnapCenter-account-<account_id>_) is used for running the scheduled backup operations.

== Create on-demand backup of the Oracle database

After assigning the policy, you can create an on-demand backup of the application.

*Steps*

. In the Applications page, click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the application and click *On-Demand Backup*.
. If multiple policies are assigned to the application, select the policy, retention value, and then click *Create Backup*.

After restoring a large database (250 GB or more), if you perform a full online backup on the same database the operation might fail with the following error:

`failed with status code 500, error {\"error\":{\"code\":\"app_internal_error\",\"message\":\"Failed to create snapshot. Reason: Snapshot operation not allowed due to clones backed by snapshots. Try again after sometime.`
