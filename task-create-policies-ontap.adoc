You can use the default backup policies provided by NetApp to create your backups, or you can create custom policies. Policies govern the backup frequency, the time the backup is taken, and the number of backup files that are retained. 

//This used to be the topic for Manage backup policies for ONTAP volumes. Recasting this for MS SQL Server apps. 

When you use the activation wizard to enable the backup and recovery service for your volumes, you can select from the default policies and any other policies that already exist in the working environment (Cloud Volumes ONTAP or on-premises ONTAP system). If you want to use a policy different than those existing policies, you can create the policy before or while you use the activation wizard.

To learn about the default backup policies provided, refer to link:concept-protection-journey.html[Plan your protection journey].

BlueXP backup and recovery provides three types of backups of ONTAP data: snapshots to local primary storage, replications to secondary storage, and backups to object storage. Their policies reside in different locations based on the architecture that you use and the type of backup:

//Create backup policies using the following tools depending on your environment, your preferences, and the protection type: 

//* BlueXP UI
//* System Manager UI
//* ONTAP CLI

//TIP: When using System Manager, select *Asynchronous* as the policy type for replication policies, and select *Asynchronous* and *Back up to cloud* for backup-to-object policies.

== View policies 

. In the BlueXP UI, select *Policies*.

image:screen-br-policies.png["Policies page"]

. Review these policy details. For explanations of architecture and ransomware protection, refer to link:concept-cloud-backup-policies.html[Backup-to-object policy options]. 

* *Workload*: Examples include Oracle, SQL Server, and Volumes. 
+
NOTE: For the Preview 2025 version, only the "SQL Server" backup type is available.
* *Backup type*: Examples include online, database, archive logs, and offline. 
* *Architecture*: Examples include local snapshot, fan-out, cascading, disk to disk, and disk to object store. 
* *Resources protected*: Shows how many resources out of the total resources on that workload are protected.
* *Ransomware protection*: Shows if the policy includes Autonomous Ransomware Protection on the local snapshot, secondary storage, and object store. 


== Create a policy

You can create policies that govern your snapshots, replications and backups to object storage: 

//* <<Create a snapshot policy before initiating a snapshot>>
//* <<Create a replication policy before initiating replication>>
//* <<Create a backup-to-object-storage policy before initiating a backup>>

//=== Create a snapshot policy before initiating a snapshot

Part of your 3-2-1 strategy involves creating a snapshot copy of the volume on the *primary* storage system. Part of the policy creation process involves identifying snapshot and SnapMirror labels that denote the schedule and retention. You can use predefined labels or create your own. 

.Steps
. In the BlueXP UI, select *Policies*.
. From the Policies page, select *Create new policy*.
+
image:screen-br-policies-new.png[Screenshot of new policy creation]

. In the Policies page, provide the following information.   

* *Details* section: 
** Workload type of "Microsoft SQL Server" is selected by default for Preview 2025 version. 
** Enter a policy name.

* *Backup architecture* section: Select the down arrow and choose the architecture for the backup, such as fan-out, cascading, and disk to disk. 
+
TIP: For explanations of architecture and ransomware protection, refer to link:concept-cloud-backup-policies.html[Backup-to-object policy options]. 

** *Local snapshot*: Local snapshot on the selected volume. Local snapshots are a key component of data protection strategies, capturing the state of your data at specific points in time. Local snapshots are created using the Snapshot technology, which provides point-in-time copies of your data without impacting performance.
** *3-2-1 fanout*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk) to coud (object store). Creates multiple copies of data across different storage systems, such as ONTAP to ONTAP and ONTAP to object-store configurations. These configurations help in achieving optimal data protection and disaster recovery.
** *3-2-1 cascaded*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk) and primary storage (disk) to cloud storage (object store). Creates a chain of data replication across multiple systems to ensure redundancy and reliability. 
** *Disk to disk*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk). The ONTAP to ONTAP data protection strategy replicates data between two ONTAP systems to ensure high availability and disaster recovery. This is typically achieved using SnapMirror, which supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication. This method ensures that your data is continuously updated and available across multiple locations, providing robust protection against data loss. 
** *Disk to object store*: Primary storage (disk) to cloud (object store). Replicates data from an ONTAP system to an object storage system, such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. This is typically achieved using SnapMirror Cloud, which provides incremental forever backups by transferring only changed data blocks after the initial baseline transfer. This method is ideal for long-term data retention and archiving, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for data protection.
** *Disk to disk fanout*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk)  and primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk).

** *3-2-1-1 cascaded*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk) and primary (disk) to cloud (object store)  (Multiple object storage) (Not available in the Preview 2025 version)

=== *Local snapshot setting* section:
* *Local snapshot setting* section: 
.. Select the *Add schedule* option to select the snapshot schedule or schedules. You can have a maximum of 5 schedules.  
** *Snapshot frequency*: Select the frequency of hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. 
** *Retention*: Enter the number of snapshots to keep.
** *Enable log backup*: Check the option to back up logs. To do this, you must have already configured a log backup. See link:br-start-configure.html[Configure log directories].
** Select whether you want to enable tamper-proof snapshots. 

=== Replication to secondary setting section: 
* *Replication to secondary setting* section: Provide information for the replication to secondary storage. 
** Select the frequency of hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. 
** Enter when and how often the replication will occur.
** *Enable snapshot locking*: Select whether you want to enable tamper-proof snapshots. 
** *Snapshot locking period*: Enter the number of days, months, or years that you want to lock the snapshot.
** *Transfer to secondary*: Select the type of transfer to secondary storage:
*** *Schedule*: Data is transferred to the secondary storage system at a later time as defined by the schedule. (This option is not available for the Preview 2025 version.)
*** *Inline*: Data is transferred to the secondary storage system immediately.

=== Backup to object store setting section:
* *Backup to object store setting* section: Provide information for the backup to object storage.
+
NOTE: The fields that appear differ depending on the provider and architecture selected. 

** *Provider*: Select a provider. 
** *Backup target*: Select the object storage target. 
** *Schedule settings*: Select the schedule that was set for the local snapshots. You can remove a schedule, but you cannot add one because the schedules are set according to the local snapshot schedules.  
** Select whether to enable integrity scans.
** Indicate how data will be encrypted.  
** *Run at*: Choose the ONTAP transfer schedule to back up data to object storage. This option is not available for the Preview version. 
** *Tier your backups from object store to archival storage*: If you choose to tier backups to archive storage (for example, AWS Glacier), select the tier option and the number of days to archive. To move older backup files to a less expensive storage class or access tier after a certain number of days, select the *Archive* option and indicate the number of days that should elapse before the data is archived. Enter *0* as the "Archive After Days" to send your backup file directly to archival storage.

=== Snapshot verification section:
* *Snapshot verification settings*: Provide information on how you want the snapshot to be verified: 

** Storage location: Select the location where the verification snapshot will be stored.
** Verification resource: Select whether the resource that you want to verify is on the local snapshot and on ONTAP secondary storage. 
** Verification schedule: Select the frequency of hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

=== Pre and post-backup scripts section:
* *Pre and post-backup scripts*: Provide information on the scripts that you want to run before and after the backup.

=== Advanced settings section:
* *Advanced settings* section:
** *Copy only backup*: Choose whether you want a full backup (includes transactional logs), log or transaction-only backup, or a copy-only backup (a type of MS SQL Server backup). 
** *Export existing snapshot copies*: Indicate whether you want to export historical snapshot copies to object storage as backup files and include them in your initial baseline backup files for future volumes. This helps you initialize your backups in the cloud by moving older snapshots into the baseline backup copy. 
** *Maximum transfer rate*: Select the network bandwidth between 1 and 1,000 Mbps allocated to upload backups to object storage. By default, ONTAP can use an unlimited amount of bandwidth to transfer the backup data from volumes in the working environment to object storage. If you notice backup traffic is affecting normal user workloads, consider decreasing the amount of network bandwidth that is used during the transfer. 
** *Yearly snapshot deletion*: Select whether you want yearly snapshots removed from the source system. Yearly backups are very large. By default, yearly snapshots are deleted automatically from the source system after being transferred to object storage. 
** *Integrity scan*: To protect your backups from being modified or deleted, select the *Integrity scan* option. The default setting for the scan frequency is for 7 days. The scan occurs only on the latest snapshot. You can enable or disable integrity scans on the latest snapshot. 
+
TIP: Enabling scans will incur extra charges, depending on the cloud provider. 
+
If your cluster is using ONTAP 9.11.1 or greater, you can choose to protect your backups from deletion by configuring _DataLock_ and _Ransomware protection_. 
+

== Edit a policy 

You can edit a custom snapshot, replication, or backup policy. 

Changing the backup policy affects all volumes that are using that policy. 

.Steps

. In the Policies page, select the policy, select the *Actions* image:icon-action.png["Actions icon"] icon, and select *Edit policy*.
+
NOTE: The process is the same for replication and backup policies. 

. In the Edit Policy page, make the changes. 
. Select *Save*. 

== Delete a policy 

You can delete policies that are not associated with any volumes. 

If a policy is associated with a volume and you want to delete the policy, you must remove the policy from the volume first. 

.Steps

. In the Policies page, select the policy, select the *Actions* image:icon-action.png["Actions icon"] icon, and select *Delete policy*.
. Select *Delete*.
