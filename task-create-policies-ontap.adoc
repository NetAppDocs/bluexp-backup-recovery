You can use the default backup policies provided by NetApp to create your backups, or you can create custom policies. Policies govern the type of backup, the backup architecture, the storage systems, and backup frequency. 

When you use the activation wizard to enable the backup and recovery service for your volumes, you can select from the default policies and any other policies that already exist in the working environment (Cloud Volumes ONTAP or on-premises ONTAP system). If you want to use a policy different than those existing policies, you must create the policy before starting the activation wizard.

To learn about the default backup policies provided, refer to link:concept-protection-journey.html[Plan your protection journey].

BlueXP backup and recovery provides three types of backups of ONTAP data: Snapshots, replications, and backups to object storage. Their policies reside in different locations due to the architecture that you use and the type of backup: 


[cols=4*,options="header",cols="25,25,25,25",width="100%"]
|===
| Architecture
| Snapshot policy storage location
| Replication policy storage location
| Backup to object policy storage location

| *Fan-out* | 
Primary |
Secondary |
Primary 
| *Cascade* | 
Primary |
Secondary |
Secondary |

Create backup policies using the following tools depending on your environment, your preferences, and the backup type: 

* BlueXP UI
* System Manager UI
* ONTAP CLI



[cols=4*,options="header",cols="25,20,30,25",width="100%"]

| Backup type

|Snapshots | Yes | Yes | Yes 
|Replications| Yes | Yes | Yes 
|Backups to object storage | Yes | No | No

TIP: When using System Manager, select *Asynchronous* as the policy type for replication policies, and select *Asynchronous* and *Back up to cloud* for backup to object policies.

Part of the policy creation process involves identifying Snapshot and SnapMirror labels that denote the schedule and retention. You can use predefined labels or create your own.

.Steps to access policies
. In the BlueXP UI, select *Volumes* > *Backup settings*.
. From the Backup Settings page, select the volume, select the *Action* image:icon-action.png["Actions icon"] icon, and select *Manage policies*.
+
The Policies page appears. 
+
image:screenshot_policies_management.png["Policies management page"]

. Continue by creating a Snapshot, replication, or backup to object storage policy. 

== Duplicate a policy
Rather than create a new policy from scratch, you can copy a policy and then customize the copy. 

.Steps

. In the Policies page, specify the policy name.
. Select the policy, select the *Actions* image:icon-action.png["Actions icon"] icon, and select *Edit Snapshot policy*. 
. Select the *Actions* image:icon-action.png["Actions icon"] icon, and select *Duplicate policy*. 
. Customize the policy. 
. Select *Save*.

== Create a Snapshot policy

Part of your 3-2-1 strategy involves creating a Snapshot copy of the volume on the *primary* storage system. 

.Steps
. In the Policies page, select *Create new policy* > *Create new Snapshot policy*.
. Specify the policy name. 
. Enable the Snapshot label. You can have a maximum of 5 labels. 
.. Specify the Snapshot labels denoting the schedule and retention. 
.. Enter when and how often the Snapshot will be taken.
.. Retention: Enter the number of Snapshots to keep.
+

. Select *Create*.

.Example for cascading architecture

This example creates a Snapshot policy with two clusters: 

. Cluster 1: 
.. Select Cluster 1 on the policy page.
..  Ignore the Replication and Backup to Object policy sections. 
.. Create the Snapshot policy. 
. Cluster 2: 
.. Select Cluster 2 on the Policy page.
.. Ignore the Snapshot policy section. 
.. Configure the Replication and Backup to object policies. 




= Create a replication policy

Your 3-2-1 strategy might include replicating a volume on a different storage system. The replication policy resides on the *secondary* storage system. 

.Steps
. In the Policies page, select *Create new policy* > *Create new Replication policy*.
. In the Policy Details section, specify the policy name. 
. Specify the SnapMirror labels (maximum of 5) denoting the retention for each label.
. Specify the transfer schedule. 
. Select *Create*.

= Create a backup to object storage policy

Your 3-2-1 strategy might include backing up a volume to object storage. 

The backup to object storage policy resides in different storage system locations depending on the backup architecture: 

* Fan-out: Primary storage system
* Cascading: Secondary storage system


.Steps
. In the Policy management page, select *Create new policy* > *Create new Backup policy*.
. In the Policy Details section, specify the policy name. 
. Specify the SnapMirror labels (maximum of 5) denoting the retention for each label.
. Specify the transfer schedule. 
. (Optional) To protect your backups from being modified or deleted, select the *DataLock* option.
+
If your cluster is using ONTAP 9.11.1 or greater, you can choose to protect your backups from deletion by configuring _DataLock_.

. (Optional) To move older backup files to a less expensive storage class or access tier after a certain number of days, select the *Archive* option and indicate the number of days that should elapse before the data is archived.
