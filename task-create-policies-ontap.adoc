You can use the default backup policies provided by BlueXP backup and recovery to create your backups, or you can create custom policies. Policies govern the backup frequency, the time the backup is taken, and the number of backup files that are retained. 

//This used to be the topic for Manage backup policies for ONTAP volumes. Recasting this for MS SQL Server apps. 



== View policies 

. In the BlueXP UI, select *Policies*.
+
image:screen-br-policies.png["Policies page"]

. Review these policy details. 

* *Workload*: Examples include Oracle, SQL Server, and Volumes. 
+
NOTE: For the Preview 2025 version, only the "SQL Server" backup type is available.
* *Backup type*: Examples include online, database, archive logs, and offline. 
* *Architecture*: Examples include local snapshot, fan-out, cascading, disk to disk, and disk to object store. 
* *Resources protected*: Shows how many resources out of the total resources on that workload are protected.
* *Ransomware protection*: Shows if the policy includes snapshot locking on the local snapshot, snapshot locking on secondary storage, or DataLock locking on object storage. 


== Create a policy

You can create policies that govern your snapshots, replications to secondary storage, and backups to object storage. Part of your 3-2-1 strategy involves creating a snapshot copy of the MS SQL Server instances or databases on the *primary* storage system. 

.Before you begin

If you plan on replicating to secondary storage and want to use snapshot locking on local snapshots or on remote ONTAP secondary storage, you first need to initialize the ONTAP compliance clock on the cluster level. This is a requirement for enabling snapshot locking in the policy.

For instructions on how to do this, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/snaplock/initialize-complianceclock-task.html[Initialize the compliance clock in ONTAP^].

For information about snapshot locking in general, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/snaplock/snapshot-lock-concept.html[Snapshot locking in ONTAP^].


.Steps
. In the BlueXP UI, select *Policies*.
. From the Policies page, select *Create new policy*.
+
image:screen-br-policies-new.png[Screenshot of new policy creation]

. In the Policies page, provide the following information.   

* *Details* section: 
** Workload type of "Microsoft SQL Server" is selected by default for Preview 2025 version. 
+
NOTE: For the Preview 2025 version, only the "SQL Server" backup type is available.
** Enter a policy name.

* *Backup architecture* section: Select the down arrow and choose the architecture for the backup, such as fan-out, cascading, and disk to disk. 


** *Local snapshot*: Local snapshot on the selected volume. Local snapshots are a key component of data protection strategies, capturing the state of your data at specific points in time. Local snapshots are created using the Snapshot technology, which provides point-in-time copies of your data without impacting performance. This creates read-only, point-in-time copies of production volumes where your workloads are running. The snapshot consumes minimal storage space and incurs negligible performance overhead because it records only changes to files since the last snapshot. You can use local snapshots to recover from data loss or corruption, as well as to create backups for disaster recovery purposes.
** *3-2-1 fanout*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk) to coud (object store). Creates multiple copies of data across different storage systems, such as ONTAP to ONTAP and ONTAP to object-store configurations. These configurations help in achieving optimal data protection and disaster recovery.
** *3-2-1 cascaded*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk) and primary storage (disk) to cloud storage (object store). Creates a chain of data replication across multiple systems to ensure redundancy and reliability. 
** *Disk to disk*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk). The ONTAP to ONTAP data protection strategy replicates data between two ONTAP systems to ensure high availability and disaster recovery. This is typically achieved using SnapMirror, which supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication. This method ensures that your data is continuously updated and available across multiple locations, providing robust protection against data loss. 
** *Disk to object store*: Primary storage (disk) to cloud (object store). Replicates data from an ONTAP system to an object storage system, such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. This is typically achieved using SnapMirror Cloud, which provides incremental forever backups by transferring only changed data blocks after the initial baseline transfer. This method is ideal for long-term data retention and archiving, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for data protection.
** *Disk to disk fanout*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk)  and primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk).

//** *3-2-1-1 cascaded*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk) and primary (disk) to cloud (object store)  (Multiple object storage) 


=== Create a local snapshot policy 
Provide information for the local snapshot.

* Select the *Add schedule* option to select the snapshot schedule or schedules. You can have a maximum of 5 schedules.  
* *Snapshot frequency*: Select the frequency of hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. 
* *Retention*: Enter the number of snapshots to keep.
* *Enable log backup*: Check the option to back up logs and set the frequency and retention of the log backups. To do this, you must have already configured a log backup. See link:br-start-configure.html[Configure log directories].

* Optionally, select *Advanced* to set the SnapMirror label and enable snapshot locking: 

** *SnapMirror label*: The label serves as a marker for transferring a specified snapshot according to the retention rules of the relationship. Applying a label to a snapshot marks it as a target for SnapMirror replication.
** *Enable snapshot locking*: Select whether you want to enable tamper-proof snapshots. Enabling this option ensures that the snapshots cannot be deleted or altered until the specified retention period has expired. This feature is crucial for protecting your data against ransomware attacks and ensuring data integrity.         

=== Create a policy for secondary settings (replication to secondary storage)
Provide information for the replication to secondary storage. 

* *Backup*: Select the frequency of hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. 
* *Backup target*: Select the target system on secondary storage for the backup.
* *Retention*: Enter the number of snapshots to keep.

* *Enable snapshot locking*: Select whether you want to enable tamper-proof snapshots. 
* *Snapshot locking period*: Enter the number of days, months, or years that you want to lock the snapshot.
* *Transfer to secondary*: Select the type of transfer to secondary storage:
** *Inline*: Data is transferred to the secondary storage system immediately.
** *Schedule*: Data is transferred to the secondary storage system at a later time as defined by the schedule. 
+
NOTE: This feature is not available in the Preview 2025 version.


=== Create a policy for object storage settings

Provide information for the backup to object storage.

NOTE: The fields that appear differ depending on the provider and architecture selected. 

==== Create a policy for AWS object storage

Enter information in these fields: 

* *Provider*: Select *AWS*. 
* *AWS account*: Select the AWS account. 
* *Backup target*: Select a registered S3 object storage target. Ensure that the target is accessible within your backup environment. 
* *Schedule settings*: Select the schedule that was set for the local snapshots. You can remove a schedule, but you cannot add one because the schedules are set according to the local snapshot schedules.  
* *Retention*: Enter the number of snapshots to keep.
* *Run at*: Choose the ONTAP transfer schedule to back up data to object storage. 
+
NOTE: This feature is not available in the Preview 2025 version.
* *Tier your backups from object store to archival storage*: If you choose to tier backups to archive storage (for example, AWS Glacier), select the tier option and the number of days to archive. To move older backup files to a less expensive storage class or access tier after a certain number of days, select the *Archive* option and indicate the number of days that should elapse before the data is archived. Enter *0* as the "Archive After Days" to send your backup file directly to archival storage.

==== Create a policy for Microsoft Azure object storage

Enter information in these fields: 

* *Provider*: Select *Azure*. 
* *Azure subscription*: Select the Azure subscription from those discovered.
* *Azure resource group*: Select the Azure resource group from those discovered.
* *Backup target*: Select a registered S3 object storage target. Ensure that the target is accessible within your backup environment.  
* *Schedule settings*: Select the schedule that was set for the local snapshots. You can remove a schedule, but you cannot add one because the schedules are set according to the local snapshot schedules.  
* Select whether to enable integrity scans.
* Indicate how data will be encrypted.  
* *Run at*: Choose the ONTAP transfer schedule to back up data to object storage. 
+
NOTE: This feature is not available in the Preview 2025 version.

To move older backup files to a less expensive storage class or access tier after a certain number of days, select the *Archive* option and indicate the number of days that should elapse before the data is archived. Enter *0* as the "Archive After Days" to send your backup file directly to archival storage.


==== Create a policy for StorageGRID object storage 
Enter information in these fields: 

* *Provider*: Select *StorageGRID*. 
* *Backup target*: Select a registered S3 object storage target. Ensure that the target is accessible within your backup environment.   
* *Schedule settings*: Select the schedule that was set for the local snapshots. You can remove a schedule, but you cannot add one because the schedules are set according to the local snapshot schedules.  
* Select whether to enable integrity scans.
* Indicate how data will be encrypted.  
* *Run at*: Choose the ONTAP transfer schedule to back up data to object storage. 
+
NOTE: This feature is not available in the Preview 2025 version.
* *Tier your backups from object store to archival storage*: If you choose to tier backups to archive storage, select the tier option and the number of days to archive. To move older backup files to a less expensive storage class or access tier after a certain number of days, select the *Archive* option and indicate the number of days that should elapse before the data is archived. Enter *0* as the "Archive After Days" to send your backup file directly to archival storage.






=== Configure advanced settings in the policy 

* *Copy only backup*: Choose whether you want a full backup (includes transactional logs), log or transaction-only backup, or a copy-only backup (a type of MS SQL Server backup). 
//* *Export existing snapshot copies*: Indicate whether you want to export historical snapshot copies to object storage as backup files and include them in your initial baseline backup files for future volumes. This helps you initialize your backups in the cloud by moving older snapshots into the baseline backup copy. 
//* *Maximum transfer rate*: Select the network bandwidth between 1 and 1,000 Mbps allocated to upload backups to object storage. By default, ONTAP can use an unlimited amount of bandwidth to transfer the backup data from volumes in the working environment to object storage. If you notice backup traffic is affecting normal user workloads, consider decreasing the amount of network bandwidth that is used during the transfer. 
//* *Yearly snapshot deletion*: Select whether you want yearly snapshots removed from the source system. Yearly backups are very large. By default, yearly snapshots are deleted automatically from the source system after being transferred to object storage. 
//* *Integrity scan*: To protect your backups from being modified or deleted, select the *Integrity scan* option. The default setting for the scan frequency is for 7 days. The scan occurs only on the latest snapshot. You can enable or disable integrity scans on the latest snapshot. 
//+
//TIP: Enabling scans will incur extra charges, depending on the cloud provider. 

//* *Availability group settings*: Select preferred backup replicas or specify a particular replica.
//* *Backup retries*: Enter the maximum number of backup retries and the retry interval.
