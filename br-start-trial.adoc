A BlueXP backup and recovery 30-day free trial is available if you sign up for a pay-as-you-go subscription in your cloud provider's marketplace to *NetApp Intelligent Services*. The free trial starts at the time that you subscribe to the marketplace listing. Note that if you pay for the marketplace subscription when deploying a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, and then start your BlueXP backup and recovery free trial 10 days later, you'll have 20 days remaining to use the free trial.

When the free trial ends, you'll be switched over automatically to the PAYGO subscription without interruption. If you decide not to continue using BlueXP backup and recovery, just end the free trial.
