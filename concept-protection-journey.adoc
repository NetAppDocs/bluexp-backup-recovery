The BlueXP backup and recovery service enables you to create up to three copies of your workloads to protect your data. There are many options that you can select when using this service, so you should review your choices so you're prepared.

We'll go over the following options:

* Which protection features will you use: snapshot copies, replicated volumes, and back up to cloud?
* Which backup architecture will you use, for example, a cascade or fan-out backup?
* Will you use the default backup policies, or do you need to create custom policies?
* Do you want the service to create the cloud buckets for you, or do you want to make your object storage containers before you begin?
* Which BlueXP Connector deployment mode are you using (standard, restricted, or private mode)? For the Preview version, only the standard mode is supported.

== Which protection features will you use

Before you select the features you'll use, here's a quick explanation of what each features does, and what type of protection it provides.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="20,70",width="90%"]
|===
| Backup type
| Description

| Snapshot | 
Creates a read-only, point-in-time image of the resource within the source location as a snapshot copy. You can use the snapshot copy to recover resoures. 
| Replication | 
Creates a secondary copy of your data on another ONTAP storage system and continually updates the secondary data. Your data is kept current and remains available whenever you need it. 
| Cloud backup | 
Creates backups of your data to the cloud for protection and for long-term archival purposes. If necessary, you can restore resources from the backup to the same, or different, working environment.

|===

Snapshots are the basis of all the backup methods, and they are required to use the backup and recovery service. A snapshot copy is a read-only, point-in-time image of a resource. The image consumes minimal storage space and incurs negligible performance overhead because it records only changes to files since the last snapshot copy was made. The snapshot copy that is created is used to keep the replicated resource and backup file synchronized with changes made to the source resource - as shown in the figure.

image:diagram-321-overview.png["A diagram showing how backup files exist on the source system as snapshot copies, as replicated on the secondary storage system, and as a backup files in object storage."]

You can choose to create both replicated resources on another ONTAP storage system and backup files in the cloud. Or you can choose just to create replicated resources or backup files - it's your choice. 



NOTE: The initial creation of a replicated workload or backup includes a full copy of the source data -- this is called a _baseline transfer_. Subsequent transfers contain only differential copies of the source data (the snapshot).

*Comparison of the different backup methods*

The following table shows a generalized comparison of the three backup methods. While object storage space is typically less expensive than your on-premises disk storage, if you think you might restore data from the cloud frequently, then the egress fees from cloud providers can reduce some of your savings. You'll need to identify how often you need to restore data from the backup files in the cloud.

In addition to this criteria, cloud storage offers additional security options if you use the snapshot locking and DataLock feature, and additional cost savings by selecting archival storage classes for older backup files.

== Which architecture will you use

When creating both replicated workloads and backup files, you can choose among several architectures to back up your workloads. The basis for many of the architectures are the fan-out and cascade architectures: 

* A *fan-out* architecture transfers the snapshot copy independently to both the destination storage system and the backup object in the cloud.
+
image:diagram-321-fanout-detailed.png["A diagram showing how a snapshot copy of a volume is used to create and update a replicated volume and a backup file."]

* A *cascade* architecture transfers the snapshot copy to the destination storage system first, and then that system transfers the copy to the backup object in the cloud.
+
image:diagram-321-cascade-detailed.png["A diagram showing how a snapshot copy of a volume is used to create and update a replicated volume and a backup file."]

This table provides a comparison of the basic fan-out and cascade architectures.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="50,50"]
|===

| Fan-out
| Cascade

| Small performance impact on the source system because it is sending snapshot copies to 2 distinct systems | Less effect on the performance of the source storage system because it sends the snapshot copy only once
| Easier to set up because all policies, networking, and ONTAP configurations are done on the source system | Requires some networking and ONTAP configuration to be done from the secondary system as well.

|===

*Architecture choices*

For the BlueXP backup and recovery Preview 2025 version, you can choose among the following architectures: 


** *Local snapshot*: Local snapshot on the selected volume. Local snapshots are a key component of data protection strategies, capturing the state of your data at specific points in time. Local snapshots are created using the Snapshot technology, which provides point-in-time copies of your data without impacting performance. This creates read-only, point-in-time copies of production volumes where your workloads are running. The snapshot consumes minimal storage space and incurs negligible performance overhead because it records only changes to files since the last snapshot. You can use local snapshots to recover from data loss or corruption, as well as to create backups for disaster recovery purposes.
** *3-2-1 fanout*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk) to coud (object store). Creates multiple copies of data across different storage systems, such as ONTAP to ONTAP and ONTAP to object-store configurations. These configurations help in achieving optimal data protection and disaster recovery.
** *3-2-1 cascaded*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk) and primary storage (disk) to cloud storage (object store). Creates a chain of data replication across multiple systems to ensure redundancy and reliability. 
** *Disk to disk*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk). The ONTAP to ONTAP data protection strategy replicates data between two ONTAP systems to ensure high availability and disaster recovery. This is typically achieved using SnapMirror, which supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication. This method ensures that your data is continuously updated and available across multiple locations, providing robust protection against data loss. 
** *Disk to object store*: Primary storage (disk) to cloud (object store). Replicates data from an ONTAP system to an object storage system, such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. This is typically achieved using SnapMirror Cloud, which provides incremental forever backups by transferring only changed data blocks after the initial baseline transfer. This method is ideal for long-term data retention and archiving, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for data protection.
** *Disk to disk fanout*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk)  and primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk).

//** *3-2-1-1 cascaded*: Primary storage (disk) to secondary storage (disk) and primary (disk) to cloud (object store)  (Multiple object storage) 



== Will you use the default policies for snapshot copies, replications, and backups

You can use the default policies provided by NetApp to create your backups, or you can create custom policies. When you enable the backup and recovery service, you can select from the default policies and any other policies that already exist in the working environment. If you want to use a policy different than those existing policies, you can create the policy.

If you create custom policies for replication or backup, the policy labels (for example, "daily" or "weekly") must match the labels that exist in your snapshot policies. 



== Do you want to create your own object storage container

When you create backup files in object storage for a working environment, by default, the backup and recovery service creates the container (bucket or storage account) for the backup files in the object storage account that you have configured. 

* The AWS or GCP bucket is named "netapp-backup-<uuid>" by default. 
* The Azure Blob storage account is named "netappbackup<uuid>".

You can create the container yourself in the object provider account if you want to use a certain prefix or assign special properties. If you want to create your own container, you must create it before starting a backup. BlueXP backup and recovery can use any bucket and share buckets. The backup process will automatically discover your provisioned containers for the selected account and credentials so that you can select the one you want to use. 

//The container must be used exclusively for storing ONTAP volume backup files - it cannot be used for any other purpose.

You can create the bucket from BlueXP, or from your cloud provider.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-blob-storage/task-add-blob-storage.html[Create Azure Blob storage accounts from BlueXP^]

//* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-117/tenant/creating-s3-bucket.html[Create S3 buckets for StorageGRID^]


*Note:* At this time you cannot use your own S3 buckets when creating backups in StorageGRID systems.

//If you plan to use a different bucket prefix than "netapp-backup-xxxxxx", then you'll need to modify the S3 permissions for the Connector IAM Role. For details, refer to how to create backups to AWS S3.

*Advanced bucket settings*

If you plan to move older backup files to archival storage, or if you plan to enable snapshot locking and DataLock to lock your backup files and perform integrity scans, you'll need to create the container with certain configuration settings:

* Archival storage on your own buckets is supported in AWS S3 storage at this time when using ONTAP 9.10.1 or greater software on your clusters. By default, backups start in the S3 _Standard_ storage class. Ensure that you create the bucket with the appropriate lifecycle rules:

** Move the objects in the entire scope of the bucket to S3 _Standard-IA_ after 30 days.
** Move the objects with the tag "smc_push_to_archive: true” to _Glacier Flexible Retrieval_ (formerly S3 Glacier)

* Snapshot locking and DataLock are supported in AWS storage when using ONTAP 9.11.1 or greater software on your clusters, and Azure storage when using ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater software. 

** For AWS, you must enable Object Locking on the bucket using a 30-day retention period.
** For Azure, you need to create the Storage Class with version-level immutability support.

== Which BlueXP Connector deployment mode are you using

If you're already using BlueXP to manage your storage, then a BlueXP Connector has already been installed. 
* If you plan to use the same Connector with BlueXP backup and recovery, then you're all set. 
* If you need to use a different Connector, you'll need to install it before starting your backup and recovery implementation.

BlueXP offers multiple deployment modes that enable you to use BlueXP in a way that meets your business and security requirements. _Standard mode_ leverages the BlueXP SaaS layer to provide full functionality, while _restricted mode_ and _private mode_ are available for organizations that have connectivity restrictions. 

NOTE: The BlueXP backup and recovery Preview 2025 version works only in standard mode, not restricted or private modes.
