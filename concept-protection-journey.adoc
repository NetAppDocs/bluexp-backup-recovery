The BlueXP backup and recovery service provides the ability for you to create up to three copies of your source volumes to protect your data. There are many options that you can select when enabling this service on your volumes, so you should review your choices up front so you are prepared.

We'll go over the following options:

* Which protection features will you use: Snapshot copies, replicated volumes, and/or backup to cloud
* Which backup architecture will you use: a cascade or fan-out backup of your volumes
* Will you use the default backup policies, or do you need to create custom policies before you begin
* Do you want the service to create the cloud buckets for you, or do you want to make your object storage containers before you begin
* Which BlueXP Connector deployment mode are you using (standard, restricted, or private mode)

== Which protection features will you use

Before you select the features you want to use, here's a quick explanation of what each features does, and what type of protection it provides.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,65",width="90%"]
|===
| Backup type
| Description

| Snapshot | 
Creates a read-only, point-in-time image of a volume within the source volume as a Snapshot copy. You can use the Snapshot copy to recover individual files, or to restore the entire contents of a volume. 
| Replication | 
Creates a secondary copy of your data on another ONTAP storage system and continually updates the secondary data. Your data is kept current and remains available whenever you need it. 
| Cloud backup | 
Creates backups of your data to the cloud for protection and for long-term archival purposes. If necessary, you can restore a volume, folder, or individual files from the backup to the same, or different, working environment.

|===

Snapshots are the basis of all the backup methods, and they are required to use the backup and recovery service. A Snapshot copy is a read-only, point-in-time image of a volume. The image consumes minimal storage space and incurs negligible performance overhead because it records only changes to files since the last Snapshot copy was made. The Snapshot copy that is created on your volume is used to keep the replicated volume and backup file synchronized with changes made to the source volume - as shown in the figure.

You can choose to create both replicated volumes on another ONTAP storage system and backup files in the cloud. Or you can choose to just create replicated volumes or backup files - its your choice. The service also enables you to select two Replication destinations if you want to protect your data in an additional location (both with and without creating backups).

=== Comparison of different backup methods

The following table shows a generalized comparison of the three backup methods. While object storage space is typically less expensive than you on=premises disk storage, if you think you may restore data from the cloud frequently, then the egress fees from cloud providers can reduce some of your savings. You'll need to identify how often you may need to restore data from the backup files in the cloud.

In addition to this criteria, cloud storage offers additional security options if you use the DataLock and Ransomware Protection feature, and additional cost savings by selecting archival storage classes for older backup files.

== Which backup architecture will you use

When creating both replicated volumes and backup files, you can choose a fan-out or cascade architecture to back up your volumes.

A fan-out architecture transfers the Snapshot copy to both the destination storage system and the backup object in the cloud.

A cascade architecture transfers the Snapshot copy to the destination storage system first, and then from that system to the backup object in the cloud. This method has less affect on the performance of the source storage system.

== Will you use the default backup policies for Snapshots, replications, and backups

You can use the default policies provided by NetApp to create your backups, or you can create custom policies. When you use the activation wizard to enable the backup and recovery service for your volumes, you can select from the default policies and any other policies that already exist in the working environment (Cloud Volumes ONTAP or on-premises ONTAP system). If you want to use a policy different than those existing policies, you must create the policy before starting the activation wizard.

* The default Snapshot policy creates hourly, daily, and weekly Snapshot copies, retaining six hourly, two daily, and two weekly Snapshot copies.
* The default Replication policy replicates daily and weekly Snapshot copies, retaining seven daily and 52 weekly Snapshot copies.
* The default Backup policy .......

If you create custom policies for Replication or Backup, the labels defined by those policies must match labels that exist in your Snapshot policies of replicated volumes and backup files won't be created. You can create custom policies using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.



=== Do you want the service to create the cloud buckets for you

When creating backup files in cloud storage, by default the backup and recovery service will create the bucket (or container) where the backup files will reside. You can create the container yourself if you want to create the bucket with a certain name or properties. If you want to create your own container, you must create the container before starting the activation wizard.

You can create the container from BlueXP, or from your cloud provider.

== Which BlueXP Connector deployment mode are you using

If you're already using BlueXP to manage your storage, then a BlueXP Connector has already been installed. If you plan to use the same Connector with BlueXP backup and recovery, then you're all set. If you need to use a different Connector, you'll need to install it before starting your backup and recovery implementation.

BlueXP offers multiple deployment modes that enable you to use BlueXP in a way that meets your business and security requirements. _Standard mode_ leverages the BlueXP SaaS layer to provide full functionality, while _restricted mode_ and _private mode_ are available for organizations that have connectivity restrictions. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-modes.html[Learn more about BlueXP deployment modes].

=== Support for sites with limited connectivity

BlueXP backup and recovery can be used in a site with limited internet connectivity (also known as "restricted mode") to back up and restore volume data. In this case, you'll need to deploy the BlueXP Connector in the restricted region. 

//* You can back up data from local on-premises ONTAP systems to local NetApp StorageGRID systems. See link:task-backup-onprem-private-cloud.html[Backing up on-premises ONTAP data to StorageGRID] for details.
ifdef::aws[]
* You can back up data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems installed in AWS commercial regions to Amazon S3. See link:task-backup-to-s3.html[Backing up Cloud Volumes ONTAP data to Amazon S3].
endif::aws[]
ifdef::azure[]
* You can back up data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems installed in Azure commercial regions to Azure Blob. See link:task-backup-to-azure.html[Backing up Cloud Volumes ONTAP data to Azure Blob].
endif::azure[]

=== Support for sites with no internet connectivity

BlueXP backup and recovery can be used in a site with no internet connectivity (also known as "private mode" or "dark" sites) to back up volume data. In this case, you'll need to deploy the BlueXP Connector in private mode. 

* You can back up data from local on-premises ONTAP systems to local NetApp StorageGRID systems. See link:task-backup-onprem-private-cloud.html[Backing up on-premises ONTAP data to StorageGRID] for details.
