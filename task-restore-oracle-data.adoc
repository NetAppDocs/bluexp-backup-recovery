You can only restore the Oracle database to the same host where the backup was created. For a RAC database, the data is restored to the on-premises node where the backup was created.

Only full database with control file restore is supported. If the archive logs are not present in the AFS, you should specify the location that contains the archive logs required for recovery.

IMPORTANT: Single File Restore (SFR) is not supported.

*Steps*

. In BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
. In the *Filter By* field, select the filter *Type* and from the drop-down select *Oracle*.
. Click *View Details* corresponding to the database that you want to restore and click *Restore*.
. On the Restore Type page, perform the following actions:
.. Select *Database State* if you want to change the state of the database to the state required to perform restore and recovery operations.
+
The various states of a database from higher to lower are open, mounted, started, and shutdown. 
+
* If the database is in a higher state but the state must be changed to a lower state to perform a restore operation, you must select this check box.
* If the database is in a lower state but the state must be changed to a higher state to perform the restore operation, the database state is changed automatically even if you do not select the check box.
* If a database is in the open state, and for restore the database needs to be in the mounted state, then the database state is changed only if you select this check box.
.. Select *Control files* if you want to restore control file along with full database.
