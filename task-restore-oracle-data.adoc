You can only restore the Oracle database to the same SnapCenter Server host, same SVM, or to the same database host. For a RAC database, the data will be restored to the on-premises node where the backup was created.

NOTE: Restore of secondary backups through primary is supported.

Only full database with control file restore is supported. If the archive logs are not present in the AFS, you should specify the location that contains the archive logs required for recovery.

IMPORTANT: Single File Restore (SFR) is not supported.

*What you will need*

If you want to restore a backup that was moved to object store from secondary storage, you should add the primary working environment details and set the IP space. For more information, see link:task-manage-app-backups.html#set-ip-space-of-the-primary-working-environment[Set IP space of the primary working environment].

*Steps*

. In Cloud Manager UI, click *Backup & Restore* > *Applications*.
. In the *Filter By* field, select the filter *Type* and from the drop-down select *Oracle*.
. Click *View Details* corresponding to the database that you want to restore and click *Restore*.
. On the Restore Type page, perform the following actions:
.. Select *Database State* if you want to change the state of the database to the state required to perform restore and recovery operations.
+
The various states of a database from higher to lower are open, mounted, started, and shutdown. You must select this check box if the database is in a higher state but the state must be changed to a lower state to perform a restore operation. If the database is in a lower state but the state must be changed to a higher state to perform the restore operation, the database state is changed automatically even if you do not select the check box.
+
If a database is in the open state, and for restore the database needs to be in the mounted state, then the database state is changed only if you select this check box.
.. Select *Control files* if you want to restore control file along with full database.
.. If the snapshot is in archival storage, specify the priority to restore your data from the archival storage.
. On the Recovery Scope page, perform the following actions:
.. Specify the recovery scope.
