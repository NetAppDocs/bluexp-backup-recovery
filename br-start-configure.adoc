After you set up BlueXP, you can configure the backup and recovery settings: 

* Import and manage SnapCenter host resources
* Enable the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate
* Configure buckets on working environments

== Import and manage SnapCenter host resources

If you previously used SnapCenter to back up your resources, you can import and manage those resources in BlueXP backup and recovery. With this option, you can import SnapCenter Server information to register multiple Snapcenter servers and discover the database workloads.

This is a two-part process:

* Import SnapCenter host resources
* Manage selected SnapCenter host resources

=== Import SnapCenter host resources

This first step imports host resources from SnapCenter and displays those resources in the BlueXP backup and recovery Inventory page. At that point, the resources are not yet managed by BlueXP backup and recovery.

.Steps 

. In the BlueXP backup and recovery UI, select *Settings*. 
. Select *Import from SnapCenter*.

.. *Username* and *Password*: Enter the username and password for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Port*: Enter the port number for the SnapCenter Server.
. Select *Import* to validate your entries and register the SnapCenter Server.

NOTE: If the SnapCenter Server is already registered, you can  update the existing registration details.

=== Manage SnapCenter host resources

After you import the SnapCenter resources, manage those host resources in BlueXP backup and recovery. After you select to manage those resources, BlueXP backup and recovery can back up and recover the resources that you imported from SnapCenter. You no longer manage those resources in SnapCenter Server. 

.Steps 
. After you import the SnapCenter resources, on the Inventory page that appears, select the SnapCenter resources that you imported that you want to have BlueXP backup and recovery manage from now on.  

. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Manage* to manage the resources.
