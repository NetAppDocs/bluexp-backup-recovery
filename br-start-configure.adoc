[.lead]
After you set up BlueXP, you can configure the backup and recovery settings: 

* Import and manage SnapCenter host resources.
* Add host credentials for the Windows and SQL Server hosts that you imported from SnapCenter.
* Enable the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.
* Configure buckets in working environments by enabling DataLock and ransomware protection scanning. 

== Import and manage SnapCenter host resources

If you previously used SnapCenter to back up your resources, you can import and manage those resources in BlueXP backup and recovery. With this option, you can import SnapCenter Server information to register multiple Snapcenter servers and discover the database workloads.

This is a two-part process:

* Import SnapCenter host resources
* Manage selected SnapCenter host resources

=== Import SnapCenter host resources

This first step imports host resources from SnapCenter and displays those resources in the BlueXP backup and recovery Inventory page. At that point, the resources are not yet managed by BlueXP backup and recovery.

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP backup and recovery menu, select *Settings*. 
. Select *Import from SnapCenter*.

.. *SnapCenter IP*: Enter the IP address of the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Username* and *Password*: Enter the username and password for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Port*: Enter the port number for the SnapCenter Server.
. Select *Import* to validate your entries and register the SnapCenter Server.
+
NOTE: If the SnapCenter Server is already registered, you can  update the existing registration details.

=== Manage SnapCenter host resources

After you import the SnapCenter resources, manage those host resources in BlueXP backup and recovery. After you select to manage those resources, BlueXP backup and recovery can back up and recover the resources that you imported from SnapCenter. You no longer manage those resources in SnapCenter Server. 

.Steps 
. After you import the SnapCenter resources, on the Inventory page that appears, select the SnapCenter resources that you imported that you want to have BlueXP backup and recovery manage from now on.  

. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Manage* to manage the resources.   
+

. Select *Manage in BlueXP*. 
+
The Inventory page shows *Managed* under the host name to incidate that the selected host resources are now managed by BlueXP backup and recovery.


=== Edit imported SnapCenter resources

You can later re-import SnapCenter resources our edit the imported SnapCenter resources to update the registration details.

You can change port and password details for the SnapCenter Server.


.Steps
. From the BlueXP backup and recovery menu, select *Settings*. 
. Select the down arrow for *Import from SnapCenter*.
+ 
The Import from SnapCenter page shows all previously imports. 

+

. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Edit* to update the resources.   

. Update the SnapCenter password and port details, as needed.
. Select *Import*. 


== Enable credentials for host resources

Enable credentials for the host resources that you imported from SnapCenter. If you don't already have credentials, you can create them. These credentials must have required permissions to access and manage the host workloads.


After BlueXP backup and recovery discovers hosts, you can change the password, but you cannot delete the credentials for that host. 

.Steps
. From the BlueXP backup and recovery menu, select *Settings*.
+

* *Name*: Enter a name for the credentials.
* *Authentication mode*: For the Preview 2025 version, select *Windows* or *Microsoft SQL*. 
+
TIP: You need to enter credentials for both Windows and Microsoft SQL Server, so you'll need to add two sets of credentials.

.  If you selected *Windows*:
* *Connector*: Enter the BlueXP Connector IP address. 
* *Domain and user name*: Enter the NetBIOS or domain FQDN and user name for the credentials.
* *Password*: Enter the password for the credentials.

. If you selected *Microsoft SQL*:
*  *Host*: Select a discovered SQL Server host address.
*  *SQL Server instance*: Select a discovered SQL Server instance.

. Select *Add*.


=== Edit credentials for host resources

You can later edit the password for the host resources that you imported from SnapCenter.


.Steps
. From the BlueXP backup and recovery menu, select *Settings*.
. Select the down arrow for *Credentials*.

. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Edit credentials*.   
+
* *Password*: Enter the password for the credentials.

. Select *Save*.


== Enable the Certificate Authority certificate

Enable Certificate Authority (CA) certificates to secure communication among components of the BlueXP backup and recovery system, including the BlueXP Connector, ONTAP, and the SnapCenter plug-in. This ensures that the data transmitted is encrypted and authenticated, protecting against unauthorized access. 

.Steps
. From the BlueXP backup and recovery menu, select *Settings*.

. Select the down arrow for *Enable CA certificates*.

. Select *Upload* for the ONTAP or plug-in certificates.
. Locate and select the certificate file.

. Select *Save*.

== Configure buckets in working environments

Using the BlueXP backup and recovery Advanced Settings options, you can configure buckets in working environments. Buckets are the storage locations where you store your backup data. You should configure these settings when you first begin using BlueXP backup and recovery.   

You can configure the following settings:   

* Enable DataLock on a bucket
* Enable ransomware protection scanning on a bucket
* Set the scan interval between 1 and 7 days

NOTE: These features are not available in the Preview 2025 version.
