[.lead]
After you set up BlueXP, you can configure the backup and recovery settings: 

* Add host credentials for the Windows and SQL Server hosts that you imported from SnapCenter and add credentials for the Microsoft SQL Server application.
* Maintain VMware vCenter settings.
* Provide StorageGRID credentials.
* Import and manage SnapCenter host resources.
* Enable the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.
* Configure log directories in snapshots for Windows hosts.
* Configure buckets in working environments by enabling DataLock and ransomware protection scanning. 

== Add credentials for host resources

Add credentials for the host resources that you want to import from SnapCenter. Host credentials are used to discover new workloads and apply backup policies.

If you don't already have credentials, you can create them. These credentials must have required permissions to access and manage the host workloads.

You need to configure the following types of credentials: 

* Microsoft SQL Server credentials
* SnapCenter Windows host credentials 

After BlueXP backup and recovery discovers hosts, you can change the password, but you cannot delete the credentials for that host. 

.Steps
. From the BlueXP backup and recovery menu, select *Settings*.

== Import and manage SnapCenter host resources

If you previously used SnapCenter to back up your resources, you can import and manage those resources in BlueXP backup and recovery. With this option, you can import SnapCenter Server information to register multiple Snapcenter servers and discover the database workloads.

This is a two-part process:

* Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources
* Manage selected SnapCenter host resources

=== Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources

This first step imports host resources from SnapCenter and displays those resources in the BlueXP backup and recovery Inventory page. At that point, the resources are not yet managed by BlueXP backup and recovery.

TIP: After you import SnapCenter host resources, BlueXP backup and recovery does not take over protection management. To do so, you must explicitly select to manage these resources in BlueXP backup and recovery.  

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP backup and recovery menu, select *Settings*. 
. Select *Import from SnapCenter*.
+

.. *Port*: Enter the port number for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Username* and *Password*: Enter the username and password for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Connector*: Select the BlueXP Connector for SnapCenter.


. Enter *SnapCenter server host credentials*:
.. *Existing credentials*: If you select this option, you can use the existing credentials that you have already added. Enter the credentials name. 
.. *Add new credentials*: If you don't have existing SnapCenter host credentials, you can add new credentials. Enter the credentials name, authentication mode, user name, and password.

. Select *Import* to validate your entries and register the SnapCenter Server.
