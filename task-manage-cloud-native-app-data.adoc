== View backup details

You can view total number of backups created, policies used for creating backups, database version, and agent ID.

. Click *Backup & Restore* > *Applications*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the application and click *View Details*.

IMPORTANT: The agent ID is associated to the Connector. If a Connector that was used during discovery of the application is changed, the subsequent backups of that application will fail because the agent ID of the new Connector is different. You can run the *connector-update* API to modify the agent ID.

== Monitor jobs

You can monitor the status the jobs that have been initiated in your working environments. This allows you to see the jobs that have completed successfully, those currently in progress, and those that have failed so you can diagnose and fix any problems.

You can view a list of all the operations and their status. Each operation, or job, has a unique ID and a status. The status can be:

* Successful
* In Progress
* Queued
* Warning
* Failed

*Steps*

* sort the results by using the filter in each column heading
