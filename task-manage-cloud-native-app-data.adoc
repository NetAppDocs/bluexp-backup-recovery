== View backup details

You can view total number of backups created, policies used for creating backups, database version, and agent ID.

. Click *Backup & Restore* > *Applications*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the application and click *View Details*.

IMPORTANT: The agent ID is associated to the Connector. If a Connector that was used during registering the Oracle database host no longer exists, the subsequent backups of that application will fail because the agent ID of the new Connector is different. You should run the *connector-update* API to modify the agent ID.

== Updating the Connector Details

If a Connector that was used during registering the Oracle database host no longer exists or is corrupted in AWS, you should deploy a new connector. After deploying the new connector, you should run the *connector-update* API to update the Connecotr details.

----
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://snapcenter.cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com/api/oracle/databases/connector-update' \
--header 'x-account-id: <CM account-id>' \
--header 'x-agent-id: <connector Agent ID >' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
"old_connector_id": "Old connector id that no longer exist",
"new_connector_id": "New connector Id"
}
----

After updating the Connector details, you should connect to the Oracle database host and perform the following steps:

. Obtain the plug-in version running on the Oracle database host.
`rpm -qi netapp-snapcenter-plugin-oracle`
. Uninstall the plug-in.
`sudo /opt/NetApp/snapcenter/spl/installation/plugins/uninstall`
. Verify that the plug-in is uninstalled successfully.
`rpm -qi netapp-snapcenter-plugin-oracle`

After uninstalling the plug-in, you can deploy the plug-in. link:reference-prereq-protect-cloud-native-app-data.html#deploy-snapcenter-plug-in-for-oracle[Learn more].

== Configure CA signed certificate

You can configure CA signed certificate if you want to include additional security to your environment.

=== Configure CA signed certificate for client certificate authentication

The connector uses a self-signed certificate to communicate with plug-in. The self-signed certificate is imported to the keystore by the installation script. You can perform the following steps to replace the self-signed certificate with CA signed certificate.

*Steps*

. Copy the certificate from _<base_mount_path>/client/certificate/certificate.p12_ to _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc/_ on the plug-in host.
+
.. Navigate to _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc_ and execute the keytool command to impot the certificate.
`keytool -v -importkeystore -srckeystore certificate.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS -srcstorepass snapcenter -deststorepass snapcenter -srcalias agentcert -destalias agentcert -noprompt`
.. Set *ENABLE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_AUTHENTICATION* to *true* in the _spl.properties_ file.
.. Restart SPL: `systemctl restart spl`
+
The file name should be certificate.pem and key.pem.
. Create the PKCS12 format of the certificate with the name certificate.p12 and keep at the same location _<base_mount_path>/client/certificate_.
. Copy the PKCS12 file plug-in host at _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc/_.
+
Copy the intermediate ca and root ca certificates also.
. Navigate to _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc_ and run the keytool command to import the certificate.
`keytool -v -importkeystore -srckeystore certificate.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS -srcstorepass snapcenter -deststorepass snapcenter -srcalias agentcert -destalias agentcert -noprompt`
. Import the CA cert files.
`keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore keystore.jks -storepass snapcenter -alias trustedca -file certificate.crt`
+
NOTE: The CA cert files is chain of intermediate and root ca certificates like NetAppCorpIssuingCA1.crt and NetAppCorpRootCA.crt.

=== Configure CA signed certificate for server certificate of plug-in

The CA certificate should have the exact name of the Oracle plug-in host with which the agent communicates.

*Steps*

. Perform the following steps on the plug-in host:
.. Navigate to the folder containing the SPLâ€™s keystore _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc_.
.. Locate the file 'keystore.jks'.
.. List the added certificates in the keystore: `keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks`
.. Add the CA certificate having both private and public key.
`keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <CertificatePathToImport> -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS`
.. List the added certificates in the keystore.
`keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks`
.. Verify that the keystore contains the alias corresponding to the new CA certificate, which was added to the keystore.
.. Change the added private key password for CA certificate to the keystore password.
+
Default SPL keystore password is the value of the key _SPL_KEYSTORE_PASS_ in _spl.properties_ file.
`keytool -keypasswd -alias "<aliasNameOfAddedCertInKeystore>" -keystore keystore.jks`
.. If the alias name in the CA certificate is long and contains space or special characters ("*",","), change the alias name to a simple name:
`keytool -changealias -alias "<OrignalAliasName>" -destalias "<NewAliasName>" -keystore keystore.jks`
.. Configure the alias name from the keystore located in spl.properties file.
+
Update this value against the key SPL_CERTIFICATE_ALIAS.
.. Restart the service after configuring the CA signed key pair to SPL trust-store.
.. Copy the entire chain of CA certificates to the persistent volume located at _<base_mount_path>/server_.
. Perform the following steps on the Connector:
.. Connect to the cloudmanager_scs_cloud and modify the *enableCACert* in _config.yml_ to *true*.
`sudo docker exec -t cloudmanager_scs_cloud sed -i 's/enableCACert: false/enableCACert: true/g' /opt/netapp/cloudmanager-scs-cloud/config/config.yml`
.. Restart cloudmanager_scs_cloud docker.
`sudo docker restart cloudmanager_scs_cloud`.

== Monitor jobs

You can monitor the status the jobs that have been initiated in your working environments. This allows you to see the jobs that have completed successfully, those currently in progress, and those that have failed so you can diagnose and fix any problems.

You can view a list of all the operations and their status. Each operation, or job, has a unique ID and a status. The status can be:

* Successful
* In Progress
* Queued
* Warning
* Failed

*Steps*

. Click *Backup & Restore*.
. Click *Job Monitoring*
+
You can click the name of a job to view details corresponding to that operation. If you are looking for specific job, you can:

* use the time selector at the top of the page to view jobs for a certain time range
* enter a part of the job name in the Search field
* sort the results by using the filter in each column heading

== Access REST APIs

You should obtain the user token with federated authentication to access the REST APIs. For information to obtain the user token, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-automation/platform/create_user_token.html#create-a-user-token-with-federated-authentication[Create a user token with federated authentication].

For the Cloud Manager API documentation, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-automation/index.html[Cloud Manager platform API documentation].
