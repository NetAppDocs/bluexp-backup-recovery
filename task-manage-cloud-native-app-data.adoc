== View backup details

You can view total number of backups created, policies used for creating backups, database version, and agent ID.

. Click *Backup & Restore* > *Applications*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the application and click *View Details*.

IMPORTANT: The agent ID is associated to the Connector. If a Connector that was used during registering the Oracle database host no longer exists, the subsequent backups of that application will fail because the agent ID of the new Connector is different. You should run the *connector-update* API to modify the agent ID.

== Updating the Connector Details

If a Connector that was used during registering the Oracle database host no longer exists or is corrupted in AWS, you should deploy a new connector. After deploying the new connector, you should run the *connector-update* API to update the Connecotr details.

* Successfut
* In Progress
* Queued
* Warning
* Failed

*Steps*

* enter a part of the job name in the Search field
* sort the results by using the filter in each column heading
