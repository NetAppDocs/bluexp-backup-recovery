Cloud Backup for Applications is a SaaS based service that provides data protection capabilities for applications running on NetApp Cloud Storage. Cloud Backup for Applications enabled within BlueXP (formerly Cloud Manager) offers efficient, application consistent, policy-based backup, and restore of the following applications:

* Oracle databases residing on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP or Cloud Volumes ONTAP
* SAP HANA databases residing on Azure NetApp Files (ANF).

== Architecture

The Cloud Backup for Applications architecture includes the following components.

* Cloud Backup for Applications is a set of data protection services hosted as a SaaS service by NetApp and is based on the BlueXP SaaS platform.
+
It orchestrates the data protection workflows for applications residing on NetApp Cloud Storage.
* Cloud Backup for Applications UI is integrated with BlueXP UI.
+
The Cloud Backup for Applications UI offers multiple storage and data management capabilities.
* BlueXP Connector is a component that runs in your cloud network and interacts with storage system and application specific plug-in.

* The application specific plug-in is a component that runs on each application host and interacts with the databases running on the host while performing data protection operations.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them:

For any user-initiated request, the Cloud Backup for Applications UI communicates with the BlueXP SaaS which upon validating the request processes the same. If the request is to run a workflow such as a backup or restore, the SaaS service initiates the workflow and where required, forwards the call to the BlueXP Connector. The Connector then communicates with with storage system and application specific plug-in. as part of running the workflow tasks.

The Connector can be deployed in the same VPC as that of the applications, or in a different one. If the Connector and applications are on different network, you should establish a network connectivity between them.

IMPORTANT: Cloud Backup for Applications infrastructure is resilient to availability zone failures within a region. It now supports regional failures by failing over to a new region and this failover involves a downtime of around 2 hours.

== Oracle database

=== Supported configurations

* Operating System:
** RHEL 7.5 or later and 8.x
** OL 7.5 or later and 8.x
* Storage System: Amazon FSx for ONTAP or Cloud Volumes ONTAP
* Storage layouts: NFS v3 and v4.1 (dNFS is supported) and iSCSI with ASM (ASMFD, ASMLib and ASMUdev)
* Database layouts: Oracle Standard and Oracle Enterprise Standalone (legacy and multitenant CDB and PDB)
* Database versions: 12cR2, 18c, 19c, and 21c

=== Features

* Auto-discovery of Oracle databases
* Backing up Oracle databases
** Full (data + control + archive log files) backup
** On-demand backup
** Scheduled backup based on the system-defined or custom policies
+
You can specify different scheduling frequencies such as hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly in the policy.
* Retaining backups based on the policy
* Restoring complete Oracle database (data files + control file) from the specified backup
* Restoring data files only and control files only from the specified backup
* In SAN layout, if SnapCenter Plug-in for Oracle finds any foreign files other than Oracle data files on the ASM diskgroup, connect and copy restore method is performed. The foreign files could be one or more of the following types:
** Parameter
** Password
** archive log
** online log
** ASM parameter file.
+
You should select Force in-place restore checkbox to override the foreign files of type parameter, password, and archive log.
* Recovering Oracle database with until SCN, until time, all available logs, and no recovery options
* Monitoring backups and other jobs
* Displaying the protection summary on the dashboard
* Sending alerts through email

=== Limitations

* Does not support Oracle 11g
* Does not support mount, clone, catalog, and verification operations on backups
* Does not support Oracle on RAC and Data Guard
* For Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA, only one of the network interface IPs are used. If the connectivity of the IP goes down or if you cannot access the IP, the operations fail.
* The network interface IP addresses of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP or Cloud Volumes ONTAP needs to be unique in the BlueXP account and region.
* Backup limitations:
** Does not support online data or log only backups
** Does not support offline backups
** Does not support backing up of Oracle database residing on recursive mount points
** Does not support consistency group Snapshots for Oracle databases residing on Multiple ASM disk groups with overlap of FSx volumes
** If your Oracle databases are configured on ASM, ensure your SVM names are unique across the FSx systems. If you have same SVM name across FSx systems, back up of Oracle databases residing on those SVMs are not supported.
* Restore limitations:
** Does not support granular restores, for example restoring of tablespaces and PDBs
** Both in-place and connect-and-copy restore methods are used if some of disk groups contain foreign files. However, using both the methods at the same time to perform restore is not supported and the restore operation fails. The database will be left in mounted state and you need to manually bring the database to open state.
+
The failure message due to the presence of foreign files are not displayed in the job page in UI due to a known issue. Check the connector logs if there is a failure during SAN pre-restore stage to know the cause of the issue.
* Clone limitations:
** Cloning of databases on iSCSI on NFS layouts are not supported
** Cloning of databases on SAN layouts such LVM, native device, and VMWare disk are not supported
** Scheduled clones (Clone LifeCycle management) is not supported
** Cloning a cloned database is not supported
** Cloning of databases residing on Qtree is not supported

== SAP HANA database

=== Supported configurations

* Operating System:
** RHEL 7.4 or later, 8.x platforms certified by SAP HANA    
** SLES 12 SP3 or later and 15 SPX platforms certified by SAP HANA 
* Storage System: Azure NetApp Files (ANF)
* Storage layouts: NFSv3 and NFSv4.1 are supported. For data and log, Azure supports only NFSv4.1.
* Database layouts: 
** Single container version 1.0SPS12
** SAP HANA Multitenant Database Container (MDC) 2.0SPS4, 2.0SPS5, 2.0SPS6 with single or multiple tenants
** SAP HANA single host system, SAP HANA multiple host system (without a standby host), HANA System Replication
** HANA SSL  

=== Features

* Manually add SAP HANA systems
* Backing up SAP HANA databases
** On-demand backup (File-based and Snapshot copy based)
** Scheduled backup based on the system-defined or custom policies
+
You can specify different scheduling frequencies such as hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly in the policy.

* Retaining backups based on the policy
* Restoring complete SAP HANA database from the specified backup
