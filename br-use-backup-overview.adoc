summary: You can back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID, ensuring that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

Back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID to ensure that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

After activation of BlueXP backup and recovery, the service creates block-level, incremental forever backups that are stored on another ONTAP cluster and in object storage in the cloud. BlueXP backup and recovery leverages NetApp's SnapMirror data replication technology to ensure that all the backups are fully synchronized by creating Snapshot copies and transferring them to the backup locations.

The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:

* Multiple data copies provide multi-layer protection against both internal (insider) and external cybersecurity threats.
* Multiple media types ensure failover viability in the case of physical or logical failure of one media type.
* The onsite copy facilitates quick restores, with the offsite copies at the ready just in case the onsite copy is compromised.

In addition to your source volume, you'll have the following protection:

* Snapshot copy of the volume on the source system
* Replicated volume on a different (secondary) storage system
* Backup of the volume in object storage

When necessary, you can restore an entire volume, a folder, or one or more files, from any of the backup copies to the same or different working environment.

You can accomplish the following protection goals: 

* Back up workloads with local snapshots on local ONTAP primary storage
* Replicate workloads to ONTAP secondary storage
* Back up workloads to an object store location (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, ONTAP S3, and StorageGRID)
* Back up workloads now with ad hoc backups
