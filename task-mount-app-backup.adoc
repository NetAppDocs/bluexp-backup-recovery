SnapCenter does not support restore of Oracle and HANA backups to alternate host. Thus, Cloud Backup for Applications allows you to mount the Oracle and HANA backups to the given host.

*Steps*

. In Cloud Manager UI, click *Backup & Restore* > *Applications*.
.	In the Filter By field, select *Type* and from the drop-down either select *SAP HANA* or *Oracle*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the protected application and select *View Details*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the backup and select *Mount*.
.. Specify the FQDN or IP address of the host to which alternate volumes restored for object store are exported.
.. Specify the initiators of the host to which LUNs of alternate volume restored for object store are mapped.
.. Specify the suffix that will be added to the alternate volume name.
.. Click *Mount*.

This operation performs only the storage mount on the give host. You should manually mount the filesystem and bring up the database. After utilizing the alternate volume, the storage Administrator should delete the storage volumes from Cloud Backup Applications.
