BlueXP backup and recovery for Applications allow you to mount the Oracle and HANA backups to the alternate host. 

SnapCenter does not support restore of Oracle and HANA backups to alternate host. Thus, mount option is provided for you to mount the Oracle and HANA backups to the alternate host.

*Steps*

. In BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
. In the Filter By field, select *Type* and from the drop-down either select *SAP HANA* or *Oracle*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the protected application and select *View Details*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the backup and select *Mount*.
.. Specify one of the following:
... For NAS environment, specify the FQDN or IP address of the host to which the volumes restored from object store are to be exported.
... For SAN environment, specify the initiators of the host to which LUNs of the volumes restored from object store are to be mapped.
.. Specify the suffix that will be added to the volume name.
.. If the snapshot is in archival storage, specify the priority to retrieve your data from the archival storage.
.. Click *Mount*.

This operation mounts only the storage on the given host. You should manually mount the filesystem and bring up the database. After utilizing the volume, the storage Administrator can delete the volume from the ONTAP cluster.
