You can clone an Oracle database using the backup of the database either to the source database host or to an alternate host. You can clone the backup from primary storage systems.

You might clone databases for the following reasons:

* To test functionality that must be implemented using the current database structure and content during application development cycles.
* To populate data warehouses using data extraction and manipulation tools.
* To recover data that was mistakenly deleted or changed.
