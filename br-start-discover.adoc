[.lead]
The BlueXP backup and recovery service needs to first discover data in order for you to use the service. During discovery, BlueXP backup and recovery analyzes all volumes and files in working environments within your organization. 

For the Preview 2025 version, BlueXP backup and recovery assesses Microsoft SQL Server applications. The service assesses the existing protection level including the current backup protection, Snapshot copies, and backup and recovery options. 

For the Preview version, discovery occurs in the following ways: 

* If you already have SnapCenter, import SnapCenter resources into BlueXP backup and recovery by using the BlueXP backup and recovery UI.
* If you don't have SnapCenter aleady, you can discover workloads in your working environments.


//NOTE: Workloads with volumes that use FlexGroup or iSCSI will not be discovered. 

== If SnapCenter is already installed, import SnapCenter resources into BlueXP backup and recovery

If you already have SnapCenter installed, import SnapCenter resources into BlueXP backup and recovery using these steps. The BlueXP service discovers resources, hosts, credentials, and schedules from SnapCenter; you don't have to recreate all that information. 

You can do this in the following ways: 

* During discovery, select an option to import SnapCenter resources.
* After discovery, from the Settings menu, select an option to import SnapCenter resources. For details, see link:br-start-configure.html[Configure BlueXP backup and recovery].

== Import and manage SnapCenter host resources during discovery

If you previously used SnapCenter to back up your resources, you can import and manage those resources in BlueXP backup and recovery. With this option, you can import SnapCenter Server information to register multiple Snapcenter servers and discover the database workloads.

This is a two-part process:

* Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources
* Manage selected SnapCenter host resources

=== Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources

This first step imports host resources from SnapCenter and displays those resources in the BlueXP backup and recovery Inventory page. At that point, the resources are not yet managed by BlueXP backup and recovery.

TIP: After you import SnapCenter host resources, BlueXP backup and recovery does not take over protection management automatically. To do so, you must explicitly select to manage these resources in BlueXP backup and recovery. This ensures that you are ready to have those resources backed up by BlueXP backup and recovery. 

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Backup and recovery*.

=== Manage SnapCenter host resources

After you import the SnapCenter resources, manage those host resources in BlueXP backup and recovery. After you select to manage those resources, BlueXP backup and recovery is able to back up and recover the resources that you imported from SnapCenter. You no longer manage those resources in SnapCenter Server. 

.Steps 
. After you import the SnapCenter resources, select *Inventory*. 
. From the Inventory page, select the imported SnapCenter resources that you want to have BlueXP backup and recovery manage from now on.
