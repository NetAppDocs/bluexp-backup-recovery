You can back up the applications data from ONTAP to Microsoft Azure by integrating Cloud Backup for Applications with BlueXP and on-premises SnapCenter.

You can protect one or more applications simultaneously to the cloud using a single policy.

IMPORTANT: You can protect only one application at a time if you are using the BlueXP GUI. However, if you are using REST APIs, you can protect multiple applications simultaneously.

*Steps*

. In BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the application and click *Activate Backup*.
. In the Assign Policy page, select the policy and click *Next*.
. Add the working environment.
+
Configure the ONTAP cluster that hosts the SVM on which the application is running. After adding the working environment for one of the applications, it can be reused for all the other applications residing on the same ONTAP cluster.
+
.. Select the SVM and click *Add Working Environment*.
.. In the Add Working Environment wizard:
... Specify the IP address of the ONTAP cluster.
... Specify the admin credentials.
+
Cloud Backup for Applications supports only cluster admin.
.. Click *Add Working Environment*.
. Select *Microsoft Azure* as the cloud provider.
.. Specify the Azure subscription ID.
.. Select the region where you want to create the backups.
.. Either create a new resource group or use an existing resource group.
.. Specify the IP space.
.. Select the archive tier.
+
It is recommended to set the archival tier because this is an one time activity and you will not be allowed to set it up later.
. Review the details and click *Activate Backup*.
