=== Microsoft SQL Server workload supported in General Availability (GA)

We are excited to announce that Microsoft SQL Server workload support is now generally available (GA) in BlueXP Backup & Recovery. Organizations using an MSSQL environment on ONTAP, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP storage can now take advantage of this new backup and recovery service to protect their data. 

This release includes the following enhancements to the Microsoft SQL Server workload support from the previous preview version: 

* *SnapMirror active sync*: This version now supports SnapMirror active sync (also referred to as SnapMirror Business Continuity [SM-BC]), enables business services to continue operating even through a complete site failure, supporting applications to fail over transparently using a secondary copy. BlueXP backup and recovery now supportsprotection of Microsoft SQL Server databases in a SnapMirror active sync and Metrocluster configuration. The information appears in the *Storage and relationship status* section of the Protection details page.

=== High performance indexing for AWS, Azure, and GCP is generally available

In February 2025, we announced the preview of high performance indexing (Indexed Catalog v2) for AWS, Azure, and GCP. This feature is now generally available (GA). In June 2025, we provided it to all new customers by default. With this release, the support is available to all customers. High performance indexing improves the performance of backup and restore operations for workloads that are protected to object storage. 

Enabled by default: 

* If you are a new customer, high performance indexing is enabled by default. 
* If you are an existing customer, you can enable reindexing by going to the Restore section of the UI.



=== ONTAP volume workload enhancements

* *Multi-folder restore for ONTAP volumes*: Until now, you could restore either one folder or multiple files at a time from the Browse and restore feature. BlueXP backup and recovery now provides the ability to select multiple folders at a time using the Browse and restore feature.

* *View and manage backups of deleted volumes*: The BlueXP backup and recovery Dashboard now gives an option to show and manage volumes that are deleted from ONTAP. With this, you can view and delete backups from volumes that no longer exist in ONTAP.
