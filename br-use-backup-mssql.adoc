[.lead]
Back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID to ensure that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.


* Back up workloads with local snapshots on local ONTAP primary storage
* Replicate snapshots to ONTAP secondary storage
* Back up workloads to an object store location (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and StorageGRID)
* Back up workloads now with ad hoc backups 

== View workload protection status
Before you initiate a backup, you can view the protection status of your workloads.

.Steps 
. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Backup and recovery*. 

. Select *Inventory*. 
+

. Select a workload to view the protection details. 
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details*.   
+

. Review details on the Hosts, Instances, and Databases tabs. 

=== Configure logs for discovered hosts

Before you back up your workloads, you can configure activity logs for discovered hosts. This helps you to track the status of operations.

.Steps 

. From the menu, select *Inventory*. 
+

. Select a workload to view the protection details. 
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details*.   
+

. Provide the host path or browse through a list of hosts or nodes hosts on the host.
. Select those on which you want logs. 
+
NOTE: The fields that appear differ depending on the selected deployment model, for example, failover cluster instance or standalone. 
. Select *Save*.

=== Suspend the backup schedule
Suspending the schedule prevents the backup from running at the scheduled time temporarily. You might want to do this if you're performing maintenance on the system or if you're experiencing issues with the backup.

NOTE: This feature is not available in Preview mode.

== Back up workloads with local snapshots on local ONTAP primary storage

TBD

== Replicate snapshots to ONTAP secondary storage


Replicating snapshots to secondary storage provides the following benefits:  

* Replicate data between ONTAP storage systems to support backup and disaster recovery.
* Ensure the reliability of your DR environment with high availability.
* Native ONTAP in-flight encryption set up via Pre-Shared Key (PSK) between the two systems.
* Copied data is immutable until you make it writable and ready to use.
* Replication is self-healing in the event of a transfer failure.
* When compared to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-replication/index.html[BlueXP replication service^], the replication in BlueXP backup and recovery includes the following features:
** Replicate multiple FlexVol volumes at a time to a secondary system.
** Restore a replicated volume to the source system or to a different system using the UI.
** Manage replication policies

== Back up workloads to an object store location (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and StorageGRID)

Backing up workloads to an object store location provides the following benefits:

* Back up independent copies of your data volumes to low-cost object storage.
* Apply a single backup policy to all volumes in a cluster, or assign different backup policies to volumes that have unique recovery point objectives.
* Create a backup policy to be applied to all future volumes created in the cluster.
* Make immutable backup files so they are locked and protected for the retention period.
* Scan backup files for possible ransomware attack - and remove/replace infected backups automatically.
* Tier older backup files to archival storage to save costs.
* Delete the backup relationship so you can archive unneeded source volumes while retaining volume backups.
* Back up from cloud to cloud, and from on-premises systems to public or private cloud.
* Backup data is secured with AES-256 bit encryption at-rest and TLS 1.2 HTTPS connections in-flight.
* Use your own customer-managed keys for data encryption instead of using the default encryption keys from your cloud provider.
* Support for up to 4,000 backups of a single volume.

== Back up workloads now with ad hoc backups
