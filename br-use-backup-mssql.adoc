summary: Back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID to ensure that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

Back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID to ensure that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

Back up Microsoft SQL Server workloads in the following ways:

* Back up workloads with local snapshots to local ONTAP primary storage
* Replicate snapshots to ONTAP secondary storage
* Back up workloads to an object store location (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and StorageGRID)
* Back up workloads now with ad hoc backups 

Before you back up data, you might want to view the current workload protection status and configure how you want logs to be backed up. 

To back up workloads, typically you create a schedule using policies that govern the backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for more information.

If you want an immediate backup, you can perform an ad hoc backup.


== View workload protection status
Before you initiate a backup, view the protection status of your workloads.

.Steps

Before you back up your workloads, you can configure activity logs for discovered hosts. This helps you to track the status of operations.

.Steps 

. From the menu, select *Inventory*.

. Provide the host path or browse through a list of hosts or nodes hosts on the host.
. Select those on which you want logs. 
+
NOTE: The fields that appear differ depending on the selected deployment model, for example, failover cluster instance or standalone. 
. Select *Save*.



== Back up workloads now with ad hoc backups 

Ad hoc backups are backups that you can run immediately. You might want to run an ad hoc backup if you're about to make changes to your system and want to ensure that you have a backup before you start.

.Steps 

. From the menu, select *Inventory*. 
+
image:screen-br-inventory.png[Inventory screenshot for BlueXP backup and recovery]
. Select a workload to view the protection details. 
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details*.   
+
image:screen-br-inventory-details-configurelog-option.png[Inventory details page screenshot showing the Actions menu for BlueXP backup and recovery]
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Back up now*.

. Select the backup type:
** Full backup*: 
** Log backup*: To choose a log backup, you must have already configured a log backup location. See link:br-use-backup-mssql.html#configure-logs-for-discovered-hosts[Configure logs for discovered hosts] for more information.

. Select the tier. 
. Select *Back up now*.

== Suspend the backup schedule
Suspending the schedule prevents the backup from running at the scheduled time temporarily. You might want to do this if you're performing maintenance on the system or if you're experiencing issues with the backup.

NOTE: This feature is not available in Preview mode.
