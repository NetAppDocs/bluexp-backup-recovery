summary: Back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID to ensure that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

Back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and StorageGRID to ensure that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

TIP: To back up workloads on a schedule, you create policies that govern the backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for more information.

In addition to backing up workloads using policies, you can accomplish the following protection goals:

* Configure logs for discovered hosts before you initiate a backup. 

* Back up workloads now (create an on-demand backup now).  



== View workload protection status
Before you initiate a backup, view the protection status of your workloads.

.Steps 
. From the BlueXP backup and recovery menu, select *Inventory*.

. Select a workload to view the protection details. 
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details*.   
+

. Review details on the Hosts, Instances, and Databases tabs. 


== Configure logs for discovered hosts

Before you back up your workloads, set the path for the activity logs for discovered hosts. This helps you to track the status of operations.

.Steps 

. From the menu, select *Inventory*. 
+

. Select a workload to view the protection details. 
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details*.   
. Select a host. 
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Configure log directory*. 
+

. Provide the host path or browse through a list of hosts or nodes hosts on the host to locate where you want the host log to be stored.
. Select those on which you want to store the logs. 
+
NOTE: The fields that appear differ depending on the selected deployment model, for example, failover cluster instance or standalone. 
. Select *Save*.



== Back up workloads now with an on-demand backup

Create an on-demand backup immediately. You might want to run an on-demand backup if you're about to make changes to your system and want to ensure that you have a backup before you start.

.Steps 

. From the menu, select *Inventory*. 
+
image:screen-br-inventory.png[Inventory screenshot for BlueXP backup and recovery]
. Select a workload to view the protection details. 
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details*.   
. Select the *Instances* or *Databases* tab. 
. Select the instance or database you want to back up.
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Back up now*.

. Select the backup type:
** *Full backup*: Backs up workloads and logs.
** *Log backup*: Backs up only the logs. To choose a log backup, you must have already configured a log backup location. See link:br-use-backup-mssql.html#configure-logs-for-discovered-hosts[Configure logs for discovered hosts] for more information.


. Select *Back up now*.

//== Suspend the backup schedule

//Suspending the schedule prevents the backup from running at the scheduled time temporarily. You might want to do this if you're performing maintenance on the system or if you're experiencing issues with the backup.
