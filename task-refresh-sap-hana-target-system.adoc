You can perform a refresh of a SAP HANA target system with the data of a SAP HANA source system. This can be used to provide the current production data into a test system. Cloud backup allows you to select a Snapshot copy from a source system and creates a new Azure NetApp Files volume based on the Snapshot copy. Example scripts are available, which executes the required operations on the database host to recover the SAP HANA database.  

*Before you begin*

* You should install the SAP HANA target system before you execute the first refresh operation.
* You should add the source and target HANA systems manually into cloud backup.
* Ensure that the SAP HANA database version is same on source and the target system.
* You should have decided on which refresh scripts to be used. The refresh scripts are available in the solution technical report.

+
You can customize the refresh scripts.
* The following environmental variables are available as part of the prescript and postscript:
** CLONED_VOLUMES_MOUNT_PATH 
** <SOURCEVOLUME>_DESTINATION
** HANA_DATABASE_TYPE 
** TENANT_DATABASE_NAMES 

*About this task*

* System refresh is supported only for multi-tenant database container HANA system.
* The existing policies will be valid after the system refresh. 
* The new volumes created will have the following naming convention: <sourcevolumename>-<timestamp>
** Timestamp format: <year><month><day>-<hour><minute><second>
+
For example, if the source volume is vol1, the refreshed volume name will be vol1-20230109-184501

NOTE: The new volume will be placed in the same capacity pool as that of the target volumes.

* The junction path will be the same as the volume name.
* The “max throughput number” for the new volume is picked from the volume of the target system with manual Quality of Service (QoS) capacity pools.
For auto QoS capacity pools the throughput is defined by the capacity of the source volume.

*Steps*

. In the BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
. In the *Applications* page, click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] icon to select the action corresponding to the system that you want to refresh and select *System Refresh*.
. In the *System Refresh* page, perform the following actions:
.. Select source system and Snapshot copy.
.. Enter Export addresses from which the new volumes can be accessed.
.. Enter prescript, postscript, and on failure script paths.
On failure script is executed only when the system refresh operation fails.
.. Click *Refresh*.
