[.lead]
You should install the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA on each of the SAP HANA database hosts. Depending on whether the SAP HANA host has an SSH key based authentication enabled, you can follow one of the methods to install the plug-in.

* If SSH is enabled for the database host, you can install the plug-in using SSH option. <<Install the plug-in using script, Learn more>>.
* If SSH is disabled, install the plug-in manually. <<Install the plug-in manually, Learn more>>.

== Prerequisites

Before adding the host, you should ensure that the prerequisites are met.

* Ensure that either Java 11 (64-bit) Oracle Java or OpenJDK is installed on each of the SAP HANA database hosts.
* You should have added the working environment and created the Connector.
* Ensure that the Connector has connectivity to the SAP HANA database hosts.
+
For information on how to resolve the connectivity issue, refer to link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapCenter/Cloud_Backup_Application_Failed_to_validate_connectivity_from_BlueXP_connector_host_to_application_database_host[Failed to validate connectivity from BlueXP connector host to application database host].
+
When the connector is lost or if you have created a new connector, you should associate the connector with the existing application resources. For instructions to update the Connector, see link:task-manage-cloud-native-app-data.html#update-the-connector-details[Update the Connector Details].
* Ensure that the BlueXP user has the “Account Admin” role.
* You should have created the SnapCenter user and configured sudo for the non-root (sudo) user. For information, refer to link:task-deploy-snapcenter-plugin-for-sap-hana.html#configure-sudo-for-snapcenter-user[Configure sudo for SnapCenter user.]
* You should have installed the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA before adding the database host. 
* While adding the SAP HANA database hosts, you should add the HDB user store keys. The HDB secure user store key is used to store the connection information of SAP HANA database hosts securely on the client and HDBSQL client uses the secure user store key to connect to SAP HANA database host.  
* For HANA System Replication (HSR), to protect the HANA systems, you should manually register both primary and secondary HANA systems.
+
NOTE: The hostname must be the same as that of the host that is used in the HSR replication.
* Ensure that the Connector has the communication enabled to the SSH port (default: 22) if SSH based installation is performed.
* Ensure that the Connector has the communication enabled to plug-in port (default: 8145) for the data protection operations to work.
* Ensure that the you have the latest version of plug-in is installed. To upgrade the plug-in, refer to <<Upgrade SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database>>.

== Configure sudo for SnapCenter user

Create a non-root (sudo) user to install the plug-in.

.Steps

. Log into the Connector VM.
. Download the SnapCenter Linux host plug-in binary.
`sudo docker exec -it cloudmanager_scs_cloud curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1/deploy/downloadLinuxPlugin'`
. Copy the contents of *sudoer.txt* located at: _/var/lib/docker/volumes/service-manager-2_cloudmanager_scs_cloud_volume/_data/$(sudo docker ps|grep -Po "cloudmanager_scs_cloud:.*? "|sed -e 's/ *$//'|cut -f2 -d":")/sc-linux-host-plugin_
. Log into the SAP HANA system host using root user account.
. Configure sudo access for the non-root user by copying the text copied in the step 3 to _/etc/sudoers.d/snapcenter_ file.
+
In the lines you added to the _/etc/sudoers.d/snapcenter_ file, replace the _<LINUXUSER>_ with the non-root user and _<USER_HOME_DIRECTORY>_ with _home/<non-root-user>_.

== Install the plug-in using script

Configure SSH key based authentication for the SAP HANA host non-root user account and perform the following steps to install the plug-in.

.Before your begin

Ensure that the SSH connection to the Connector is enabled.

.Steps

. Log into Connector VM.
. Install the plug-in using the script provided in the Connector.
`sudo bash /var/lib/docker/volumes/service-manager-2_cloudmanager_scs_cloud_volume/_data/scripts/linux_plugin_copy_and_install.sh --host <plugin_host> --username <host_user_name> --sshkey <host_ssh_key> --pluginport <plugin_port> --sshport <host_ssh_port>`
+
If you are using an older Connector, run the following command to install the plug-in.
`sudo /var/lib/docker/volumes/cloudmanager_scs_cloud_volume/_data/scripts/linux_plugin_copy_and_install.sh --host <plugin_host> --username <host_user_name> --sshkey <host_ssh_key> --pluginport <plugin_port> --sshport <host_ssh_port>`

For example, `sudo bash /var/lib/docker/volumes/service-manager-2_cloudmanager_scs_cloud_volume/_data/scripts/linux_plugin_copy_and_install.sh --host 10.0.1.1 --username snapcenter --sshkey /keys/netapp-ssh.ppk

After installing the plug-in, you should <<Add SAP HANA database hosts>>.

== Install the plug-in manually

If SSH key based authentication is not enabled on the HANA host, you should perform the below manual steps to install the plug-in.

*Steps*

. Log in to Connector VM.
. Download the SnapCenter Linux host plug-in binary.
`sudo docker exec -it cloudmanager_scs_cloud curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1/deploy/downloadLinuxPlugin'`
+
The plug-in binary is available at: _cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/service-manager-2_cloudmanager_scs_cloud_volume/_data/$(sudo docker ps|grep -Po "cloudmanager_scs_cloud:.*? "|sed -e 's/ *$//'|cut -f2 -d":")/sc-linux-host-plugin_
. Copy _snapcenter_linux_host_plugin_scs.bin_ from the above path to _/home/<non root user (sudo)>/.sc_netapp_ path for each of the SAP HANA database hosts either using scp or other alternate methods.
. Log into the SAP HANA database host using the non-root (sudo) account.
. Change directory to _/home/<non root user>/.sc_netapp/_ and run the following command to enable execute permissions for the binary.
`chmod +x snapcenter_linux_host_plugin_scs.bin`
. Install the SAP HANA plug-in as a sudo SnapCenter user.
`./snapcenter_linux_host_plugin_scs.bin -i silent -DSPL_USER=<non-root>`
. Copy _certificate.pem_ from _<base_mount_path>/client/certificate/_ path of the Connector VM to _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc/_ on the plug-in host.
. Navigate to _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc_ and execute the keytool command to import the certificate.
`keytool -import -alias agentcert -file certificate.pem -keystore keystore.jks -deststorepass snapcenter -noprompt`
. Restart SPL: `systemctl restart spl`
. Validate that the plug-in is reachable from the Connector by running the below command from the Connector.
`docker exec -it cloudmanager_scs_cloud curl -ik \https://<FQDN or IP of the plug-in host>:<plug-in port>/PluginService/Version --cert  config/client/certificate/certificate.pem --key /config/client/certificate/key.pem`

After installing the plug-in, you should <<Add SAP HANA database hosts>>.

== Upgrade SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database

You should upgrade the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA database to gain access to the latest new features and enhancements.

*Before you begin*

* Ensure that there are no operations running on the host.

*Steps*

. Configure sudo for SnapCenter user. For information, see <<Configure sudo for SnapCenter user>>.
. Run the following script.
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/service-manager-2_cloudmanager_scs_cloud_volume/_data/scripts/linux_plugin_copy_and_install.sh --host <plugin_host> --username <host_user_name> --sshkey <host_ssh_key> --pluginport <plugin_port> --sshport <host_ssh_port> --upgrade`
+
If you are using an older Connector, run the following command to upgrade the plug-in.
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/cloudmanager_scs_cloud_volume/_data/scripts/linux_plugin_copy_and_install.sh --host <plugin_host> --username <host_user_name> --sshkey <host_ssh_key> --pluginport <plugin_port> --sshport <host_ssh_port> --upgrade`

== Add SAP HANA database hosts

You should manually add SAP HANA database hosts to assign policies and create backups. Auto discovery of SAP HANA database host is not supported.

*Steps*

.	In the *BlueXP* UI, select *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
.	Select *Discover Applications*.
.	Select *Cloud Native* > *SAP HANA* and select *Next*.
.	In the *Applications* page, select *Add System*.  
.	In the *System Details* page, perform the following actions:

..	Enter the SAP HANA system name.
..	Specify the SID of the SAP HANA system.
..	(Optional) Modify OSDB user.
//..	Select Plug-in host.  
//(Optional) If the host is not added, click *Add Plug-in Host*.
..	If HANA system is configured with HANA System replication, enable *HANA System Replication (HSR) System*.
..	Select *HDB Secure User Store Keys* text box to add user store keys details.
+
Specify the key name, system details, username, and password and click *Add Key*.
+
You can delete or modify the user store keys.
