[.lead]
You should install the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA on each of the SAP HANA database hosts. Depending on whether the SAP HANA host has an SSH key based authentication enabled, you can follow one of the methods to install the plug-in.

* If SSH is enabled for the database host, you can install the plug-in using SSH option. 
link:task-deploy-snapcenter-plugin-for-sap-hana.html#deploy-the-plug-in-using-SSH-key-based-authentication[Learn more.]
* If SSH is disabled, install the plug-in manually. link:task-deploy-snapcenter-plugin-for-sap-hana.html#deploy-the-plug-manually[Learn more.]

== Prerequisites

Before adding the host, you should ensure that the prerequisites are met.

* Ensure that either Java 11 (64-bit) Oracle Java or OpenJDK is installed on each of the SAP HANA database hosts.
* You should have added the working environment and created the Connector.
* Ensure that the Connector has connectivity to the working environment.
+
When the connector is lost or if you have created a new connector, to associate the connector with the existing application resources, refer
link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapCenter/Cloud_Backup_Application_Failed_to_validate_connectivity_from_BlueXP_connector_host_to_application_database_host[Cloud Backup Application Failed to validate connectivity from BlueXP connector host to application database host]
* Ensure that the BlueXP user has the “Account Admin” role.
* You should have created the SnapCenter user and configured sudo for the SnapCenter user. For information, refer to link:task-deploy-snapcenter-plugin-for-sap-hana.html#configure-sudo-for-snapcenter-user[Configure sudo for SnapCenter user.]
* You should have installed the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA before adding the database host. 
* While adding the SAP HANA database hosts, you should add the HDB user store keys. The HDB secure user store key is used to store the connection information of SAP HANA database hosts securely on the client and HDBSQL client uses the secure user store key to connect to SAP HANA database host.  
* For HANA System Replication (HSR), to protect the HANA systems, you should manually register both primary and secondary HANA systems.
* Ensure that the Connector has the communication enabled to the SSH port (default: 22) if SSH based installation is performed.
* Ensure that the Connector has the communication enabled to plug-in port (default: 8145) for the data protection operations to work.
* Ensure that the you have the latest version of plug-in is installed. To upgrade the plug-in, refer to <<Upgrade SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database>>.

NOTE: If the connectivity from BlueXP Connector host to application host fails, refer https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapCenter/Cloud_Backup_Application_Failed_to_validate_connectivity_from_BlueXP_connector_host_to_application_database_host[knowledge base article^] for information.

== Configure sudo for SnapCenter user

You should create a SnapCenter user to install the plug-in.

*Steps*

. Log into the Connector VM.
. Download the Linux host plug-in binary.
`sudo docker exec -it cloudmanager_scs_cloud curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1/deploy/downloadLinuxPlugin'`
. Obtain the base mount path.
`sudo docker volume ls | grep scs_cloud_volume | awk {'print $2'} | xargs sudo docker volume inspect | grep Mountpoint`
. Copy lines 1 to 16 from the `oracle_checksum_scs.txt` file located at `base_mount_path/version/sc-linux-host-plugin/`
. Log into the SAP HANA database host and perform the following steps:
.. Create the SnapCenter user account, private key pair, and assign the permissions.
.. Use the visudo Linux utility to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file and paste the lines you copied in step 4.
+
In the lines you added to the `/etc/sudoers`, replace the <LINUXUSER> with the SnapCenter user that you created and save in the visuod utility.

== Install the plug-in using SSH key based authentication

If SSH key based authentication is enabled on the HANA host for the SnapCenter user, you can perform the following steps to install the plug-in. 

*Before your begin*

Ensure that the SSH connection to the Connector is enabled.

*Steps*

. Log into the Connector VM.

. Obtain the base mount path.
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/service-manager-2_cloudmanager_scs_cloud_volume/_data`

. Install the plug-in.
`# sudo <base_mount_path>/scripts/hana_plugin_copy_and_install.sh --host <host_name> --sshkey <ssh_key_file> --username <user_name> --port <ssh_port> --pluginport <plugin_port>`

After installing the plug-in, you should add the link:task-deploy-snapcenter-plugin-for-sap-hana.html#add-sap-hana-database-hosts[SAP HANA database hosts.]

== Install the plug-in manually

If SSH key based authentication is not enabled on the HANA host, you should perform the below manual steps to install the plug-in.

*Steps*

. Log into the Connector VM.

. Download the Linux host plug-in binary.
`# sudo docker exec -it cloudmanager_scs_cloud curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1/deploy/downloadLinuxPlugin'`

. Obtain the base mount path.
`sudo docker volume ls | grep scs_cloud_volume | awk {'print $2'} | xargs sudo docker volume inspect | grep Mountpoint`

. Obtain the binary path of the downloaded plug-in.
`sudo ls <base_mount_path> $(sudo docker ps|grep -Po "cloudmanager_scs_cloud:.*? "|sed -e 's/ *$//'|cut -f2 -d":")/sc-linux-host-plugin/snapcenter_linux_host_plugin_scs.bin`

. Copy `snapcenter_linux_host_plugin_scs.bin` to each of the SAP HANA database hosts either using scp or other alternate methods.

. On the SAP HANA database host, run the following command to enable execute permissions for the binary.
`chmod +x snapcenter_linux_host_plugin_scs.bin`

. Install the SAP HANA plug-in as a sudo SnapCenter user.
`./snapcenter_linux_host_plugin_scs.bin -i silent -DSPL_USER=<non-root-user>`

. Copy `certificate.p12` from `<base_mount_path>/client/certificate/` path of the Connector VM to `/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc/` on the plug-in host.

.. Navigate to `/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc` and execute the keytool command to import the certificate.
`keytool -v -importkeystore -srckeystore certificate.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS -srcstorepass snapcenter -deststorepass snapcenter -srcalias agentcert -destalias agentcert -noprompt`
.. Restart SPL: `systemctl restart spl`

. Validate that the plug-in is reachable from the Connector by running the below command from the Connector:
+
`docker exec -it cloudmanager_scs_cloud curl -ik \https://<FQDN or IP of the plug-in host>:<plug-in port>/PluginService/Version --cert /config/client/certificate/certificate.pem --key /config/client/certificate/key.pem`

== Upgrade SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database

== Add SAP HANA database hosts

You should manually add SAP HANA database hosts to assign policies and create backups. Auto discovery of SAP HANA database host is not supported.

*Steps*

.	In the *BlueXP* UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
.	Click *Discover Applications*.
.	Select *Cloud Native* > *SAP HANA* and click *Next*.
.	In the *Applications* page, click *Add System*.  
.	In the *System Details* page, perform the following actions:
..	Select the System Type as Multi-tenant database container or Single Container.
..	Enter the SAP HANA system name.
..	Specify the SID of the SAP HANA system.
..	(Optional) Modify HDBSQL OS user.
..	Select Plug-in host.  
(Optional) If the host is not added or if you want to add multiple hosts, click *Add Plug-in Host*.
..	If HANA system is configured with HANA System replication, enable *HANA System Replication (HSR) System*.
..	Click *HDB Secure User Store Keys* text box to add user store keys details.
+
Specify the key name, system details, username, and password and click *Add Key*.
+
You can delete or modify the user store keys.
.   Click *Next*.
.	In the *Storage Footprint* page, click *Add Storage* and perform the following:
..	Select the working environment and specify the NetApp account.
+
Go to *Canvas* page to add a new working environment
..	Select the required volumes.
..	Click *Add Storage*.
.	Review all the details and click *Add System*.

NOTE: The filter to view a specific host does not work. When you specify a host name in the filter, all the hosts are displayed.

*What's next*

* You can modify or remove the SAP HANA systems from the UI and also by using REST API.  
+
Before removing the SAP HANA system, you should delete all the associated backups and remove the protection.

* You can modify or remove the SAP HANA hosts using REST API.

=== Add Non-Data Volumes
