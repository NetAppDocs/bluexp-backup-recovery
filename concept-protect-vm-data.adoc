You can protect data on your virtual machines by integrating the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere with Cloud Manager. You can back up datastores to the cloud and restore virtual machines back to the on-premises SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere with ease.

You can back up datastores to Amazon Web Services S3, Microsoft Azure Blob, or StorageGRID.

== Requirements
Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you start backing up datastores and virtual machines to cloud services.

* SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere 4.6P1 or later
* ONTAP 9.8 or later
* Cloud Manager 3.9 or later
* At least one backup should have been taken in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere 4.6P1.
* At least one daily, weekly, or monthly policy in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere with no label or same label as that of the Cloud Backup for Virtual Machines policy in Cloud Manager.
* For a pre-canned policy, the schedule tier should be the same for the datastore in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere and in the cloud.
* Ensure that there are no FlexGroup volumes in the datastore because backing up and restoring FlexGroup volumes are not supported.
* Ensure that none of the volumes are encrypted because restoring encrypted volumes are not supported.
* Disable "*_recent*" on the required resource groups. If you have "*_recent*" enabled for the resource group, then the backups of those resource groups cannot be used for data protection to cloud and subsequently cannot be used for the restore operation.
* Ensure that the destination datastore where the virtual machine will be restored has enough space to accommodate a copy of all virtual machine files such as VMDK, VMX, VMSD, and so on.
* Ensure that the destination datastore does not have stale virtual machine files in the format of restore_xxx_xxxxxx_filename from the previous restore operation failures. You should delete the stale files before triggering a restore operation.
