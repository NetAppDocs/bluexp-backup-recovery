Backups are stored in an object store in your cloud account so that you can restore data from a specific point in time. You can restore an entire Kubernetes persistent volume from a saved backup file.

You can restore a persistent volume (as a new volume) to the same working environment or to a different working environment that's using the same cloud account.

== Supported working environments and object storage providers

You can restore a volume from a Kubernetes backup file to the following working environments:

== Restoring volumes from a Kubernetes backup file

When you restore a persistent volume from a backup file, Cloud Manager creates a _new_ volume using the data from the backup. You can restore the data to a volume in the same Kubernetes cluster or to a different Kubernetes cluster that's located in the same cloud account as the source Kubernetes cluster.

Before you start, you should know the name of the volume you want to restore and the date of the backup file you want to use to create the newly restored volume.

.Steps

. Select the *Backup & Restore* service.

. Click the *Kubernetes* tab and the Kubernetes Dashboard is displayed.

. Locate the volume you want to restore, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon], and then click *Details & Backup List*.

The list of all backup files for that volume is displayed along with details about the source volume, destination location, and backup details.

. Locate the specific backup file that you want to restore based on the date/time stamp, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon], and then *Restore*.

. In the _Select Destination_ page, select the _Kubernetes cluster_ where you want to restore the volume, the _Namespace_, the _Storage Class_, and the new _Persistent volume name_.

. Click *Restore* and you are returned to the Kubernetes Dashboard so you can review the progress of the restore operation.

.Result

Cloud Manager creates a new volume in the Kubernetes cluster based on the backup you selected. You can link:task-manage-backups-kubernetes.html[manage the backup settings for this new volume] as required.
