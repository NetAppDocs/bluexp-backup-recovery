Complete a few steps to back up the applications data from ONTAP to Amazon Web Services.

*Steps*

. In BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the application and click *Activate Backup*.
. In the Assign Policy page, select the policy and click *Next*.
. Add the working environment.
+
Configure the cluster management LIF that you want BlueXP to discover. After adding the working environment for one of the applications, it can be reused for all the other applications residing on the same ONTAP cluster.
+
.. Select the SVM and click *Add Working Environment*.
.. In the Add Working Environment wizard:
... Specify the IP address of the cluster management LIF.
... Specify the credentials of the ONTAP cluster user.
+
BlueXP backup and recovery for applications only support cluster admin.
.. Click *Add Working Environment*.
. Select *Amazon Web Services* as the cloud provider.
.. Specify the AWS account.
.. In the AWS Access Key field, specify the key for data encryption.
.. In the AWS Secret Key field, specify the password for data encryption.
.. Select the region where you want to create the backups.
.. Specify the IP space.
.. Select the archival tier.
+
It is recommended to set the archival tier because this is an one time activity and you will not be allowed to set it up later.
. Review the details and click *Activate Backup*.
