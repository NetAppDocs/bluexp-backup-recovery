You can restore virtual machines data from the cloud back to the on-premises vCenter with BlueXP backup and recovery. You can restore the virtual machine to the exact same location from where the backup was taken or to an alternate location. If the virtual machine was backed up using archival policy, then you can set the archival restore priority. 

NOTE: You cannot restore virtual machines that span across datastores.

*NOTE*   To switch to and from BlueXP backup and recovery workloads, refer to link:br-start-switch-ui.html[Switch to different BlueXP backup and recovery workloads].

.Before you begin
* Ensure that you have met all the link:concept-protect-vm-data.html[requirements] before restoring virtual machines from the cloud.
* If you are restoring to an alternate location:
** Ensure that the source and destination vCenters are in linked mode.
** Ensure that the source and destination cluster details are added in BlueXP Canvas and in linked mode vCenters in both SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host.
** Ensure that the Working Environment (WE) is added corresponding to the alternate location in BlueXP Canvas.

.Steps

. In BlueXP UI, select *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Virtual Machines* > *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere* and select the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host.

NOTE: If the source virtual machine is moved to another location (vMotion), and if the user triggers a restore of that virtual machine from BlueXP, then the virtual machine is restored to the source location from where the backup was taken.

NOTE: If the restore operation does not complete, do not try the restore process again until the Job Monitor shows that the restore operation has failed. If you try the restore process again before the Job Monitor shows that the restore operation has failed, the restore operation will fail again. When you see the Job Monitor status as "Failed," you can try the restore process again.
