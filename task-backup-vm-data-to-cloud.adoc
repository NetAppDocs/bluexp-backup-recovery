You can back up datastores to the cloud by integrating the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere with Cloud Manager. This will help the VM administrators to easily and quickly back up and archive data for storage efficiency and accelerate cloud transition.

NOTE: Ensure that you have met all the link:concept-protect-vm-data.html#Requirements[requirements] before backing up datastores to the cloud.

== Register SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere

You should register the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere in Cloud Manager for the datastores and virtual machines to be displayed in Cloud Manager. Only a user with administrative access can register the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

NOTE: You can register multiple SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere. However, once registered, you cannot remove the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager UI, click *Backup & Restore* > *Virtual Machines*.
. From the *Settings* drop-down, click *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere*.
. Click *Register SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere*.
. Specify the following details:
.. In the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere field, specify the FQDN or IP address of the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
.. In the Port field, specify the port number on which the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere is running.
+
You should ensure that the port is open for communication to happen between SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere and Cloud Backup for Applications.
.. In the Username and Password field, specify the credentials of the user with the administrator role.
. Click *Register*.

*After you finish*

Click *Backup & Restore > Virtual Machines* to view all the datastores and virtual machines that are eligible for protection using the registered SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

== Create policy
You should create policies if you do not want to edit the pre-canned policies.

*Steps*

. In the Virtual machines page, from the Settings drop-down list, select *Policies*.
. Click *Create policy*.
. Specify a policy name.
. Specify the schedule and retention details.
+
By default, the backup source will selected as primary.
. Click *Create*.

== Back up datastores

You can back up one or more datastores simultaneously to the cloud using a single policy. Only the default policies can be assigned to the datastore.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager UI, click *Backup & Restore* > *Virtual Machines*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[action] corresponding to the datastore that you want to back up and click *Activate Backup*.
. In the Assign Policy page, select the policy and click *Next*.
. Add the working environment.
+
Configure the ONTAP clusters that you want Cloud Manager to discover to back up your datastores. After adding the working environment for one of the datastores, it can be reused for all the other datastores residing on the same ONTAP cluster.
+
.. Click *Add Working Environment* corresponding to the SVM.
.. In the Add Working Environment wizard:
... Specify the IP address of the ONTAP cluster.
... Specify the credentials of the ONTAP cluster user.
.. Click *Add Working Environment*.
. Select and configure the cloud provider.
