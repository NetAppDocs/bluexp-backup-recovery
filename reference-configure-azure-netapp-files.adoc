You should create the Azure NetApp Files working environment and the Connector.

== Create Azure NetApp Files working environment

You should create Azure NetApp Files working environments where your databases are hosted. For information, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-azure-netapp-files/concept-azure-netapp-files.html[Learn about Azure NetApp Files] and link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-azure-netapp-files/task-create-working-env.html[Create an Azure NetApp Files working environment].

== Create a connector
An Account Admin needs to deploy a Connector in Azure NetApp Files that enables BlueXP to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

NOTE: You cannot update the new connector_id from the UI.
