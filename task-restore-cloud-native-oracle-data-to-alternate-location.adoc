[.lead]

In the event of data loss, you can restore the Oracle database to alternate location only on Azure NetApp Files. The alternate location can be on a different host or on the same host.

.Before you begin

* If the Oracle 21c database is in STARTED state, the restore operation fails. You should run the following command to restore the database successfully.
`cp -f <ORACLE_HOME>/jdbc/lib/ojdbc8.jar /opt/NetApp/snapcenter/spl/plugins/sco/lib/ojdbc8-8.jar`
* You should ensure that the Oracle version on the alternate host is same as that of the original host.

.About this task

While initiating the restore operation, you are not allowed to modify the configurations except the Oracle home, maximum volume throughput, Oracle SID, and database credentials. 

Full recovery is enabled by default with _Until cancel_ set to true. 

Archive log mode is turned off by default for the restored database. You can enable archive log mode and keep the archive logs on the NetApp volume if required.

For the database credential, if the OS User authentication is disabled, you should provide a password for the sys user to connect to the restored database on the same or target host.
. Click *Next*, review the details and click *Restore*.

The progress of the restore operation can be viewed in the Job Monitor page. After the job is completed, click *Refresh Discovery* to view the restored database. However, you cannot protect the database that is restored to alternate location.
