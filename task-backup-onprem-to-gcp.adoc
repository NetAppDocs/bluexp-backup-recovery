Complete a few steps to get started backing up volume data from your on-premises ONTAP systems to a secondary storage system and to Google Cloud Storage.

Note that "on-premises ONTAP systems" includes FAS, AFF, and ONTAP Select systems.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps. Details for each step are provided in the following sections in this topic.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Identify the connection method you'll use

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Choose whether you’ll connect your on-premises ONTAP cluster directly to Google Cloud Storage over the public internet, or whether you’ll use a VPN or Google Cloud Interconnect and route traffic through a private Google Access interface that uses a private IP address.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
<<Identify the connection method>>.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Prepare your BlueXP Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you already have a Connector deployed in your Google Cloud or on your premises, then you're all set. If not, then you'll need to create a BlueXP Connector to back up ONTAP data to Google Cloud storage. You'll also need to customize network settings for the Connector so that it can connect to Google Cloud.

<<Activate backups on your ONTAP volumes>>.




== Identify the connection method

Choose which of the two connection methods you will use when configuring backups from on-premises ONTAP systems to Google Cloud Storage. 


* *Public connection* - Directly connect the ONTAP system to Google Cloud Storage using a public Google endpoint.
* *Private connection* - Use a VPN or Google Cloud Interconnect and route traffic through a Private Google Access interface that uses a private IP address.

The following diagram shows the *public connection* method and the connections that you need to prepare between the components. The Connector must be deployed in the Google Cloud Platform VPC.
//You can use a Connector that you've installed on your premises, or a Connector that you've deployed in the Google Cloud Platform VPC.

The following diagram shows the *private connection* method and the connections that you need to prepare between the components. The Connector must be deployed in the Google Cloud Platform VPC.
//You can use a Connector that you've installed on your premises, or a Connector that you've deployed in the Google Cloud Platform VPC.

image:diagram_cloud_backup_onprem_gcp_private.png[A diagram showing how BlueXP backup and recovery communicates over a private connection with the volumes on the cluster and the Google Cloud storage where the backup files are located.]

== Prepare your BlueXP Connector 

The BlueXP Connector is the main software for BlueXP functionality. A Connector is required to back up and restore your ONTAP data.

=== Create or switch Connectors

If you already have a Connector deployed in your Google Cloud Platform VPC, then you're all set. 

If not, then you'll need to create a Connector in that location to back up ONTAP data to Google Cloud Storage. You can't use a Connector that's deployed in another cloud provider, or on-premises.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Connectors^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-google.html[Install a Connector in GCP^]
//* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-install-connector-on-prem.html[Install a Connector in your premises^]


== Prepare networking for the Connector

Ensure that the Connector has the required networking connections.

.Steps

. Ensure that the network where the Connector is installed enables the following connections:

* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to the BlueXP backup and recovery service and to your Google Cloud storage (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-set-up-networking-google.html#endpoints-contacted-for-day-to-day-operations[see the list of endpoints^])
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your ONTAP cluster management LIF

. Enable Private Google Access (or Private Service Connect) on the subnet where you plan to deploy the Connector. https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Private Google Access^] or https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-apis#on-premises[Private Service Connect^] are needed if you have a direct connection from your ONTAP cluster to the VPC and you want communication between the Connector and Google Cloud Storage to stay in your virtual private network (a *private* connection).
+
Follow the Google instructions for setting up these Private access options. Make sure your DNS servers have been configured to point `www.googleapis.com` and `storage.googleapis.com` to the correct internal (private) IP addresses.


=== Verify or add permissions to the Connector

To use the BlueXP backup and recovery "Search & Restore" functionality, you need to have specific permissions in the role for the Connector so that it can access the Google Cloud BigQuery service. Review the permissions below, and follow the steps if you need to modify the policy.

.Steps

. In the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console^], go to the *Roles* page.

. Using the drop-down list at the top of the page, select the project or organization that contains the role that you want to edit.

. Select a custom role.

. Select *Edit Role* to update the role's permissions.

. Select *Add Permissions* to add the following new permissions to the role.
+
[source,json]
bigquery.jobs.get
bigquery.jobs.list
bigquery.jobs.listAll
bigquery.datasets.create
bigquery.datasets.get
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.getData
bigquery.tables.list
bigquery.tables.create

. Select *Update* to save the edited role.

== Verify license requirements

* Before you can activate BlueXP backup and recovery for your cluster, you'll need to either subscribe to a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) BlueXP Marketplace offering from Google, or purchase and activate a BlueXP backup and recovery BYOL license from NetApp. These licenses are for your account and can be used across multiple systems.

** For BlueXP backup and recovery PAYGO licensing, you'll need a subscription to the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager?supportedpurview=project[NetApp BlueXP offering from the Google Marketplace^]. Billing for BlueXP backup and recovery is done through this subscription.
** For BlueXP backup and recovery BYOL licensing, you'll need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. link:task-licensing-cloud-backup.html#use-a-bluexp-backup-and-recovery-byol-license[Learn how to manage your BYOL licenses].

* You need to have a Google subscription for the object storage space where your backups will be located.

*Supported regions* 

You can create backups from on-premises systems to Google Cloud Storage in all regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^]. You specify the region where backups will be stored when you set up the service.

== Prepare your ONTAP clusters 

// This section uses an include along with the 2 subsections of "Discover your ONTAP cluster in BlueXP" and "Verify ONTAP requirements"

include::../_include/backup-onprem-prepare-onprem-ONTAP-cluster.adoc[]


// === Discover your ONTAP systems in BlueXP
// FROM INCLUDE

// === Verify ONTAP system requirements
// FROM INCLUDE


=== Verify ONTAP networking requirements for backing up data to object storage

You must configure the following requirements on the system that connects to object storage. 

* When you use a fan-out backup architecture, the following settings must be configured on the source system. 
* When you use a cascaded backup architecture, the following settings must be configured on the secondary system.

The following ONTAP cluster networking requirements are needed: 

* The ONTAP cluster initiates an HTTPS connection over port 443 from the intercluster LIF to Google Cloud Storage for backup and restore operations.
+
ONTAP reads and writes data to and from object storage. The object storage never initiates, it just responds.
+
* ONTAP requires an inbound connection from the Connector to the cluster management LIF. The Connector can reside in a Google Cloud Platform VPC.

* An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to back up. The LIF must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/standard_properties_of_ipspaces.html[Learn more about IPspaces^].
+
When you set up BlueXP backup and recovery, you are prompted for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that each LIF is associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created.
* The nodes' intercluster LIFs are able to access the object store.
* DNS servers have been configured for the storage VM where the volumes are located. See how to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/configure_dns_services_auto.html[configure DNS services for the SVM^].
+
If you're using Private Google Access or Private Service Connect, make sure your DNS servers have been configured to point `storage.googleapis.com` to the correct internal (private) IP address. 
* Note that if you use are using a different IPspace than the Default, then you might need to create a static route to get access to the object storage.
* Update firewall rules, if necessary, to allow BlueXP backup and recovery connections from ONTAP to object storage through port 443, and name resolution traffic from the storage VM to the DNS server over port 53 (TCP/UDP).


===  Verify ONTAP networking requirements for replicating volumes

//This section uses an Include for all providers. It includes "Cloud Volumes ONTAP networking requirements", and "On-premises ONTAP networking requirements"  

include::../_include/backup-onprem-prepare-source-destination-systems-for-repl.adoc[]



== Prepare Google Cloud Storage as your backup target

Preparing Google Cloud Storage as your backup target involves the following steps: 

* Set up permissions.
* (Optional) Create your own buckets. (The service will create buckets for you if you want.)
* (Optional) Set up customer-managed keys for data encryption
//* Configure your system for a private connection using a VPC endpoint interface 

=== Set up permissions

When you set up backup, you need to provide storage access keys for a service account that has specific permissions. A service account enables BlueXP backup and recovery to authenticate and access Cloud Storage buckets used to store backups. The keys are required so that Google Cloud Storage knows who is making the request.

.Steps

. In the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console^], go to the *Roles* page.

. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#creating_a_custom_role[Create a new role^] with the following permissions:
+
[source,json]
storage.buckets.create
storage.buckets.delete
storage.buckets.get
storage.buckets.list
storage.buckets.update
storage.buckets.getIamPolicy
storage.multipartUploads.create
storage.objects.create
storage.objects.delete
storage.objects.get
storage.objects.list
storage.objects.update

. In the Google Cloud console, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[go to the Service accounts page^].

. Select your Cloud project.

. Select *Create service account* and provide the required information:

.. *Service account details*: Enter a name and description.
.. *Grant this service account access to project*: Select the custom role that you just created.
.. Select *Done*.

. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings[GCP Storage Settings^] and create access keys for the service account:

.. Select a project, and select *Interoperability*. If you haven't already done so, select *Enable interoperability access*.

.. Under *Access keys for service accounts*, select *Create a key for a service account*, select the service account that you just created, and click *Create Key*.
+
You'll need to enter the keys in BlueXP backup and recovery later when you configure the backup service.

=== Create your own buckets
By default, the service creates buckets for you. Or, if you want to use your own buckets, you can create them before you start the backup activation wizard and then select those buckets in the wizard. 

=== Set up customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for data encryption

You can use your own customer-managed keys for data encryption instead of using the default Google-managed encryption keys. Both cross-region and cross-project keys are supported, so you can choose a project for a bucket that is different than the project of the CMEK key. 

If you're planning to use your own customer-managed keys: 

* You'll need to have the Key Ring and the Key Name so you can add this information in the activation wizard. https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/cmek[Learn more about customer-managed encryption keys^].

* You'll need to verify that these required permissions are included in the role for the Connector:
+
[source,json]
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.get
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.getIamPolicy
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.list
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.setIamPolicy
cloudkms.keyRings.get
cloudkms.keyRings.getIamPolicy
cloudkms.keyRings.list
cloudkms.keyRings.setIamPolicy

* You'll need to verify that the Google "Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)" API is enabled in your project. See the https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis[Google Cloud documentation: Enabling APIs] for details.

*CMEK considerations:*

* Both HSM (Hardware-backed) and Software-generated keys are supported.
* Both newly created or imported Cloud KMS keys are supported.
* Only regional keys are supported, global keys are not supported.
* Currently, only the "Symmetric encrypt/decrypt" purpose is supported.
* The service agent associated with the Storage Account is assigned the "CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter (roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter)" IAM role by BlueXP backup and recovery. 



== Activate backups on your ONTAP volumes 


Activate backups at any time directly from your on-premises working environment.

A wizard takes you through the following major steps: 

* <<Select the volumes that you want to back up>>
* <<Define the backup strategy>>
* <<Review your selections>> 

You can also <<Show the API commands>> at the review step, so you can copy the code to automate backup activation for future working environments.  

=== Start the wizard 

.Steps 

. Access the Activate backup and recovery wizard using one of the following ways: 
* From the BlueXP canvas, select the working environment and select *Enable > Backup Volumes* next to the Backup and recovery service in the right-panel.
+
image:screenshot_backup_onprem_enable.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup and recovery Enable button that is available after you select a working environment.]

+
If the Google Cloud Storage destination for your backups exists as a working environment on the Canvas, you can drag the ONTAP cluster onto the Google Cloud object storage.  
* Select *Volumes* in the Backup and recovery bar. From the Volumes tab, select the *Actions (...)* option and select *Activate Backup* for a single volume (that does not already have replication or backup to object storage already enabled). . 

+ 
The Introduction page of the wizard shows the protection options including local Snapshots, replication, and backups. If you did the second option in this step, the Define Backup Strategy page appears with one volume selected. 


. Continue with the following options: 

* If you already have a BlueXP Connector, you're all set. Just select *Next*. 
* If you don't already have a BlueXP Connector, the *Add a Connector* option appears. Refer to <<Prepare your BlueXP Connector>>. 


=== Select the volumes that you want to back up

Choose the volumes you want to protect. You can choose to protect FlexVol or FlexGroup volumes; however, you cannot select a mix of these for the working environment you chose to protect.  

NOTE: You can activate a backup only on a single FlexGroup volume at a time. 

A protected volume is one that has one or more of the following: Snapshot policy, replication policy, backup to object policy. 

NOTE: If the volumes you choose have different Snapshot and replication policies than the policies you select later, the existing policies will be overwritten. 

.Steps 
. In the Select Volumes page, select the volume or volumes you want to protect. 
+
* Optionally, filter the rows to show only volumes with certain volume types, styles and more to make the selection easier. 
* After you select the first volume, then you can select all FlexVol volumes. To back up all existing FlexVol volumes and any FlexVol volumes added in the future, check one volume first and then check the box in the title row. (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[]).
+
TIP: We recommend this option so that all your volumes will be backed up and you'll never have to remember to enable backups for new volumes.

* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).


. Select *Next*.


=== Define the backup strategy 

Defining the backup strategy involves setting the following options: 

* Whether you want one or all of the backup options: local Snapshots, replication, and backup to object storage
* Architecture
* Local Snapshot policy
* Replication target and policy
+
NOTE: If the volumes you choose have different Snapshot and replication policies than the policies you select in this step, the existing policies will be overwritten. 

* Backup to object storage information (provider, encryption, networking, backup policy, and export options). 


.Steps 

. In the Define backup strategy page, choose one or all of the following. All three are selected by default: 
+
* *Local Snapshots*: If you are performing replication or back up to object storage, local Snapshots must be created. 
* *Replication*: Creates replicated volumes on another ONTAP storage system.  
* *Backup*: Backs up volumes to object storage  

. *Architecture*: If you chose replication and backup, choose one of the following flows of information: 
* *Cascading*: Information flows from the source to the secondary and from the secondary to object storage. 
* *Fan out*: Information flows from the source to the secondary _and_ from the source to object storage. 
+ 
For details, refer to ZZZ link. 

. *Local Snapshot*: Choose an existing Snapshot policy. 
+
TIP: If you want to create a custom policy, you can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI `snapmirror policy create` command. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9131/snapmirror-policy-create.html[ONTAP CLI for `snapmirror policy`^].

. *Replication*: Set the following options: 
+
* *Replication target*: Select the destination working environment and SVM. Optionally, select the destination, aggregates and prefix or suffix that will be added to the replicated volume name. 
* *Replication policy*: Choose an existing replication policy. 

. *Back up to Object*: If you selected *Backup*, set the following options: 
+
* *Provider*: Select *Google Cloud*. 
* *Provider settings*: Enter the provider details and region where the backups will be stored.
+ 
Either create a new bucket or select one that you've already created. 
+
TIP: If you want to tier older backup files to Google Cloud Archive storage for further cost optimization, ensure that the bucket has the appropriate Lifecycle rule. 

+
Enter the Google Cloud access key and secret key. 



* *Encryption key*: If you created a new Google Cloud storage account, enter encryption key information given to you from the provider. Choose whether you'll use the default Google Cloud encryption keys, or choose your own customer-managed keys from your Google Cloud account, to manage encryption of your data. 
+ 
NOTE: If you chose an existing Google Cloud storage account, encryption information is already available, so you don't need to enter it now. 
+ 
If you choose to use your own customer-managed keys, enter the key ring and key name. https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/cmek[Learn more about customer-managed encryption keys^].

* *Networking*: Choose the IPspace. 
//"Also choose whether you'll be using a Private Endpoint. Private Endpoint is disabled by default."" Private Endpoint field is not visible for GCP. 
+
The IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside. The intercluster LIFs for this IPspace must have outbound internet access.

//.. Optionally, choose whether you'll use a Google Cloud private endpoint that you have previously configured. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview[Learn about using an Azure private endpoint].



* *Backup policy*: Select an existing backup policy. 
+
TIP: If you want to create a custom policy, you can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. Refer to <link>.

. *Export existing Snapshot copies to object storage as backup copies*: If there are any local Snapshot copies for read/write volumes in this working environment that match the backup schedule label you just selected for this working environment (for example, daily, weekly, etc.), an additional prompt is displayed "*Export existing Snapshot copies to object storage as backup copies*". Check this box if you want all historic Snapshots to be copied to object storage as backup files to ensure the most complete protection for your volumes.

. Select *Next*. 

//.. Enter the name for the default policy. You don't need to change the name.
//.. Define the backup schedule and choose the number of backups to retain. link:concept-ontap-backup-to-cloud.html#customizable-backup-schedule-and-retention-settings[See the list of existing policies you can choose^].

//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.11.1 and greater, you can choose to protect your backups from deletion and ransomware attacks by configuring one of the _DataLock and Ransomware Protection_ settings. _DataLock_ protects your backup files from being modified or deleted, and _Ransomware protection_ scans your backup files to look for evidence of a ransomware attack in your backup files. link:concept-cloud-backup-policies.html#datalock-and-ransomware-protection[Learn more about the available DataLock settings^].
//+
//NOTE: If you plan to use DataLock, you must enable it in your first policy when activating BlueXP backup and recovery. You might want to protect your backups from deletion by using _DataLock_.

//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.10.1 and greater, you can choose to tier backups to either S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage after a certain number of days for further cost optimization. link:reference-aws-backup-tiers.html[Learn more about using archival tiers^].




=== Review your selections 
This is the chance to review your selections and make adjustments, if necessary. 

.Steps 

. In the Review page, review your selections. 
. Optionally check the box to *Automatically synchronize the Snapshot policy labels with the replication and backup policy labels*. This creates Snapshots with a label that matches the labels in the replication and backup policies.  
. Select *Activate Backup*. 


.Result 
BlueXP backup and recovery starts taking the initial backups of your volumes. The baseline transfer of the replicated volume and the backup file includes a full copy of the source data. Subsequent transfers contain differential copies of the source data contained in Snapshot copies.

A replicated volume is created in the destination cluster that will be synchronized with the source volume. 

A Google Cloud Storage bucket is created automatically in the service account indicated by the Google access key and secret key you entered, and the backup files are stored there. The Volume Backup Dashboard is displayed so you can monitor the state of the backups.

You can also monitor the status of backup and restore jobs using the link:task-monitor-backup-jobs.html[Job Monitoring panel^].


=== Show the API commands 
You might want to display and optionally copy the API commands used in the Activate backup and recovery wizard. You might want to do this to automate backup activation in future working environments. 

.Steps 

. From the Activate backup and recovery wizard, select *View API request*. 
. To copy the commands to the clipboard, select the *Copy* icon.
