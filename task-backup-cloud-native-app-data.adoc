You can either assign a pre-canned policy or create a policy and then assign it to the database. Once the policy is assigned, the backups are created as per the schedule defined in the policy. You can also create an on-demand backup.

NOTE: When creating ASM diskgroups for Oracle, ensure that there are no common volumes across diskgroups. Each diskgroup needs to have dedicated volumes.

*Steps*

. In the Applications page, if the database is not protected using any policy, click *Assign Policy*.
+
If the database is protected using one or more policies, you can assign more policies by clicking image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] > *Assign Policy*.
. Select the policy and click *Assign*.
+
The backups will be created as per the schedule defined in the policy.

== Create on-demand backups

After assigning the policy, you can create an on-demand backup of the application.

. In the Applications page, click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] corresponding to the application and click *On-Demand Backup*.
. If multiple policies are assigned to the application, select the policy, retention value, and then click *Create Backup*.
