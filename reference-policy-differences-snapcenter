There are some differences between policies used in SnapCenter and those used in BlueXP backup and recovery after importing resources and policies from SnapCenter.


SnapCenter and BlueXP backup and recovery use slightly different policy schedules. 

SnapCenter uses the following schedule tiers:

* *Hourly*: Multiple hours and minutes (any hour 0-23) and any minutes (0-60)
* *Daily*: Includes an option to repeate every so many days, for example, every 3 days. 
* *Weekly*: Sunday to Monday, with an option to perform a snapshot on Day 1 of the week or multiple days of the week. 
* *Monthly*: Months January to December, with an option to perform on specific days of the month, for example, the 7th of every month and even multiple days of the month. 

BlueXP backup and recovery uses the following schedule tiers, which are slightly different: 

* *Hourly*: Performs snapshots only for minutes, for example, 1 hour or 15-minute intervals less than 60.
* *Daily*: Hours of the day (0-23) with start time at 10:00 AM with an option to perform every so many hours. 
* *Weekly*: Day of the week (Sunday to Monday) with an option to perform on 1 day or multiple days. This is the same as SnapCenter. 
* *Monthly*: Dates of the month (0-30) starting time with multiple dates of the month.  
* *Yearly*: Monthly. Matches SnapCenter's monthly. 

You can assign multiple policies with the same schedule tier to a resource in SnapCenter. However, BlueXP backup and recovery does not support multiple policies on a resource that uses the same schedule tier.

For example, if you use three policies (for Data, Log, and Log of Snapshot) in SnapCenter, after migration from SnapCenter, BlueXP backup and recovery will use a single policy instead of all three. 


== SnapCenter daily schedules (was #11 in document)

BlueXP backup and recovery adjusts the SnapCenter schedules as follows: 

* If the SnapCenter schedule is set to <= 7 days, BlueXP backup and recovery sets the schedule to weekly. 
* If the SnapCenter schedule is set to >7 days, BlueXP backup and recovery sets the schedule to monthly.

== SnapCenter hourly schedules 

Every SnapCenter hourly policy with repeating intervals greater than one hour will be converted to a daily policy in BlueXP backup and recovery. 

Any hourly policy with repeating intervals that are not a factor of 24 (for example 5,7,etc) will skip some snapshots in a day.

Example: 

* SnapCenter policy: Hourly policy for every 5 hours starting at 1:00 am
* In BlueXP backup and recovery policy (after migration): Daily with the hour of the days in those 5-hour intervals [1, 6, 11, 16, and 21]. 

NOTE: Some hours are skipped, after 21 i.e. 9:00 pm it should be 2:00 am to repeat after every 5 hours, but it will be always 1:00 am.

== SnapCenter daily schedules

c.	Daily policies:
Every daily policy with repeating days interval less than equal to 7 will be converted to weekly policy in BlueXP B&R.
Similar to point (b), some snapshots will be skipped in a week.

Example, In SnapCenter:  Daily policy with every 3 days repeating interval starting at monday
BlueXP B&R post migration:  
Weekly: [mon, thrus, sun]. (Here note that some days will be skipped, it is not every 3 days exactly, after sun next backup should be on wed but it will always be on fixed days i.e.  Monday. thrus and sun)

Every daily policy with repeating days interval greater than 7 will be converted to monthly policy in BlueXP B&R.
Similar to above, Some snapshots will be missed in a month.

Example, In SnapCenter: Daily policy with every 10 days repeating interval starting 2nd of the month 

BlueXP B&R (post migration) 
Monthly: Days of the month [2,12,22] (here some days will be skipped the next month, after 22 it should be 1st of the month if the month has 31 days but here the days will be fixed to specefic dates)
d.	 Resource with multiple policies, log backup retention will be according to below priority order
FullandLog policy + log only: Pick log only policy retention values.
Full backup + log only + FullandLog: Pick log only 
FullandLog + FullBackup: Pick FullAndLog
If only full backup: Skip enable log backup

e.	Snapmirror label for every policy will remain intact post migration even though the tier is changed, Example an hourly policy from snapcenter might change to daily in BlueXP B&R.
f.	Resource with secondary protection enabled with multiple source volumes => multiple dest vols =>  multiple snapmirror relationships will be created. 
Only first policy will be chosen to get the retention count
