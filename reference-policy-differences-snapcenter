There are some differences between policies used in BlueXP backup and recovery and those used in SnapCenter.


SnapCenter and BlueXP backup and recovery use slightly different policy schedules. 

SnapCenter uses the following schedule tiers:

* *Hourly*: Multiple hours and minutes (any hour 0-23) and any minutes (0-60)
* *Daily*: Includes an option to repeate every so many days, for example, every 3 days. 
* *Weekly*: Sunday to Monday, with an option to perform a snapshot on Day 1 of the week or multiple days of the week. 
* *Monthly*: Months January to December, with an option to perform on specific days of the month, for example, the 7th of every month and even multiple days of the month. 

BlueXP backup and recovery uses the following schedule tiers, which are slightly different: 

* *Hourly*: Performs snapshots only for minutes, for example, 1 hour or 15-minute intervals less than 60.
* *Daily*: Hours of the day (0-23) with start time at 10:00 AM with an option to perform every so many hours. 
* *Weekly*: Day of the week (Sunday to Monday) with an option to perform on 1 day or multiple days. This is the same as SnapCenter. 
* *Monthly*: Dates of the month (0-30) starting time with multiple dates of the month.  
* *Yearly*: Monthly. Matches SnapCenter's monthly. 

You can assign multiple policies with the same schedule tier to a resource in SnapCenter. However, BlueXP backup and recovery does not support multiple policies on a resource that uses the same schedule tier.

For example, if you use three policies (for Data, Log, and Log of Snapshot) in SnapCenter, after migration from SnapCenter, BlueXP backup and recovery will use a single policy instead of all three. 


=== SnapCenter daily schedules (was #11 in document)

BlueXP backup and recovery adjusts the SnapCenter schedules as follows: 

* If the SnapCenter schedule is set to <= 7 days, BlueXP backup and recovery sets the schedule to weekly. 

* If the SnapCenter schedule is set to >7 days, BlueXP backup and recovery sets the schedule to monthly.
