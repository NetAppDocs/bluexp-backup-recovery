You can integrate Cloud Backup for Applications with Cloud Manager and on-premises SnapCenter to back up the application consistent Snapshots from on-premises ONTAP to cloud. When required you can restore from cloud to on-premises SnapCenter Server.

You can back up Oracle, Microsoft SQL, and SAP HANA applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and StorageGRID.

NOTE: You should be using SnapCenter Software 4.6 or later.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you start backing up application data to cloud services.

* ONTAP 9.8 or later
* Cloud Manager 3.9
* SnapCenter Server 4.6 or later
* At least one backup per application should be available in SnapCenter Server
* At least one daily, weekly, or monthly policy in SnapCenter with no label or same label as that of the Cloud Backup for Applications policy in Cloud Manager.
