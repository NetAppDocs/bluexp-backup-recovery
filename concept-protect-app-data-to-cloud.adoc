BlueXP Cloud Backup for Applications provides data protection capabilities for application consistent Snapshots from on-premises ONTAP primary to cloud provider.

You can back up Oracle, Microsoft SQL, and SAP HANA applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID.

For more information about Cloud Backup for Applications, refer to:

* https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/cbs-cloud-backup-and-snapcenter-integration[Application aware backup with Cloud Backup and SnapCenter^]
* https://soundcloud.com/techontap_podcast/episode-322-cloud-backup-for-applications[Cloud Backup for Applications podcast^]

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you start backing up application data to cloud provider.

* ONTAP 9.8 or later
* BlueXP
* SnapCenter Server 4.6 or later
You should be using SnapCenter Server 4.7 if you want to use the following features:
** Protect backups from on-premises secondary storage
** Protect SAP HANA applications
** Protect Oracle and SQL applications that are on VMware environment
** Mount backups
** Deactivate backups
** Unregister SnapCenter Server
* At least one backup per application should be available in SnapCenter Server
* At least one daily, weekly, or monthly policy in SnapCenter with no label or same label as that of the Cloud Backup for Applications policy in BlueXP.

NOTE: If SVMs are added to SnapCenter using FQDN or IP address, applications running on these SVMs cannot be protected. Cloud Backup for Applications recognizes only the SVMs that are added by name or the SVMs discovered by SnapCenter that were added as part of the ONTAP cluster.
