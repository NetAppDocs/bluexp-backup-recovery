Complete a few steps to get started backing up volume data from your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems to Amazon S3.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Verify support for your configuration

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* You're running Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 or later in AWS (ONTAP 9.8P13 and later is recommended).
* You have a valid cloud provider subscription for the storage space where your backups will be located.
* You have subscribed to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-oorxakq6lq7m4?sr=0-8&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa[BlueXP Marketplace Backup offering], an https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B086PDWSS8[AWS annual contract], or you have purchased link:task-licensing-cloud-backup.html#use-a-bluexp-backup-and-recovery-byol-license[and activated] a BlueXP backup and recovery BYOL license from NetApp.
* You have a Connector installed in AWS:
** The Connector can be installed in a site with full internet access ("standard mode") or with limited internet connectivity ("restricted mode").
** The IAM role that provides the BlueXP Connector with permissions includes S3 permissions from the latest https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions.html[BlueXP policy^].
// or without internet access ("private mode")

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Prepare your BlueXP Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you already have a Connector deployed in an AWS region, then you're all set. If not, then you'll need to install a BlueXP Connector in AWS to back up Cloud Volumes ONTAP data to AWS. The Connector can be installed in a site with full internet access ("standard mode") or with limited internet connectivity ("restricted mode").
// or without internet access ("private mode").

== Verify support for your configuration

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you start backing up volumes to S3.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them.

Optionally, you can connect to a secondary ONTAP system for replicated volumes using the public or private connection as well.

image:diagram_cloud_backup_cvo_aws.png[A diagram showing how BlueXP backup and recovery communicates with the volumes on the source systems and the destination storage where the backup files are located.]

The VPC gateway endpoint must exist in your VPC already. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html[Learn more about gateway endpoints^].

Supported ONTAP versions::
Minimum of ONTAP 9.8; ONTAP 9.8P13 and later is recommended.

Required information for using customer-managed keys for data encryption::

You can choose your own customer-managed keys for data encryption in the activation wizard instead of using the default Amazon S3 encryption keys. In this case you'll need to have the encryption managed keys already set up. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-kms.html[See how to use your own keys^].

== Verify license requirements

For BlueXP backup and recovery PAYGO licensing, a BlueXP subscription is available in the AWS Marketplace that enables deployments of Cloud Volumes ONTAP and BlueXP backup and recovery. You need to https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-oorxakq6lq7m4?sr=0-8&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa[subscribe to this BlueXP subscription^] before you enable BlueXP backup and recovery. Billing for BlueXP backup and recovery is done through this subscription.

For an annual contract that enables you to back up both Cloud Volumes ONTAP data and on-premises ONTAP data, you need to subscribe from the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-q7dg6zwszplri[AWS Marketplace page^] and then https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-aws-accounts.html[associate the subscription with your AWS credentials^].

For an annual contract that enables you to bundle Cloud Volumes ONTAP and BlueXP backup and recovery, you must set up the annual contract when you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment. This option doesn't enable you to back up on-prem data.

For BlueXP backup and recovery BYOL licensing, you need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. link:task-licensing-cloud-backup.html#use-a-bluexp-backup-and-recovery-byol-license[Learn how to manage your BYOL licenses]. You must use a BYOL license when the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP system are deployed in a dark site.

And you need to have an AWS account for the storage space where your backups will be located.

== Prepare your BlueXP Connector

The Connector must be installed in an AWS region with full or limited internet access ("standard" or "restricted" mode). https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-modes.html[See BlueXP deployment modes for details^].
//, or in a site with no internet access ("private" mode)

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Connectors^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-aws.html[Deploy a Connector in AWS in standard mode (full internet access)^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-restricted-mode.html[Install the Connector in restricted mode (limited outbound access)^]
//* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-private-mode.html[Install the Connector in private mode (no internet access)^]
//
//[NOTE]
//====
//BlueXP backup and recovery functionality is built into the BlueXP Connector. When installed in private mode, you'll need to update the Connector software periodically to get access to new features. Check the link:whats-new.html[BlueXP backup and recovery What's new] to see the new features in each BlueXP backup and recovery release, and then you can follow the steps to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html#upgrade-the-connector-when-using-private-mode[upgrade the Connector software^] when you want to use new features.
//
//We highly recommend that you create local backups of the internal BlueXP backup and recovery configuration data periodically when the Connector is installed in a site without internet connectivity. link:reference-backup-cbs-db-in-dark-site.html[See how to back up BlueXP backup and recovery data in a dark site^].
//====

=== Verify or add permissions to the Connector

The IAM role that provides BlueXP with permissions must include S3 permissions from the latest https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions-aws.html[BlueXP policy^]. If the policy does not contain all of these permissions, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-edit.html[AWS Documentation: Editing IAM policies].

Here are the specific permissions from the policy:

[%collapsible]

                "arn:aws:s3:::netapp-backup-*"
            ]
        },
====

NOTE: When creating backups in AWS China regions, you need to change the AWS Resource Name "arn" under all _Resource_ sections in the IAM policies from "aws" to "aws-cn"; for example `arn:aws-cn:s3:::netapp-backup-*`.

Required AWS Cloud Volumes ONTAP permissions::
When your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is running ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater software, the IAM role that provides that working environment with permissions must include a new set of S3 permissions specifically for BlueXP backup and recovery from the latest https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-set-up-iam-roles.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP policy^].
+
If you created the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment using BlueXP version 3.9.23 or greater, these permissions should be part of the IAM role already. Otherwise you'll need to add the missing permissions. 

Supported AWS regions::
BlueXP backup and recovery is supported in all AWS regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^], including AWS GovCloud regions. 
//It is also supported in https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS C2S and SC2S secure regions^].

Required setup for creating backups in a different AWS account::
By default, backups are created using the same account as the one used for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. If you want to use a different AWS account for your backups, you must:
* Verify that the permissions "s3:PutBucketPolicy" and "s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls" are part of the IAM role that provides the BlueXP Connector with permissions.
* Add the destination AWS account credentials in BlueXP. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-aws-accounts.html#add-additional-credentials-to-a-connector[See how to do this^].
* Add the following permissions in the user credentials in the second account:
+
 "athena:StartQueryExecution",
 "athena:GetQueryResults",
 "athena:GetQueryExecution",
 "glue:GetDatabase",
 "glue:GetTable",
 "glue:CreateTable",
 "glue:CreateDatabase",
 "glue:GetPartitions",
 "glue:BatchCreatePartition",
 "glue:BatchDeletePartition"

Create your own buckets::
By default, the service creates buckets for you. If you want to use your own buckets, you can create them before you start the backup activation wizard and then select those buckets in the wizard. 
+
link:concept-protection-journey.html#do-you-want-to-create-your-own-object-storage-container[Learn more about creating your own buckets^].  

==  Verify ONTAP networking requirements for replicating volumes

//This section uses an Include for all providers. It includes "Cloud Volumes ONTAP networking requirements", and "On-premises ONTAP networking requirements"   

include::../_include/backup-onprem-prepare-source-destination-systems-for-repl.adoc[]

//The following statement applies only to backup from CVO topics: 
* To replicate data between two Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in different subnets, the subnets must be routed together (this is the default setting).

== Enable BlueXP backup and recovery on Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Enabling BlueXP backup and recovery is easy. The steps differ slightly depending on whether you have an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system or a new one. 

*Enable BlueXP backup and recovery on a new system*

BlueXP backup and recovery is enabled by default in the working environment wizard. Be sure to keep the option enabled.

See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-otc-aws.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS^] for requirements and details for creating your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP Canvas, select *Add Working Environment*, choose the cloud provider, and select *Add New*. Select *Create Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Select *Amazon Web Services* as the cloud provider and then choose a single node or HA system.

. Fill out the Details & Credentials page.

. On the Services page, leave the service enabled and select *Continue*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_to_gcp.png[Shows the BlueXP backup and recovery option in the working environment wizard.]

. Complete the pages in the wizard to deploy the system.

.Result

BlueXP backup and recovery is enabled on the system. After you've created volumes on these Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, launch BlueXP backup and recovery and link:task-manage-backups-ontap.html#activate-backup-on-additional-volumes-in-a-working-environment[activate backup on each volume that you want to protect].
//BlueXP backup and recovery is enabled on the system and backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies.

*Enable BlueXP backup and recovery on an existing system*

Enable BlueXP backup and recovery on an existing system at any time directly from the working environment.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP Canvas, select the working environment and select *Enable* next to the Backup and recovery service in the right-panel.
+
If the Amazon S3 destination for your backups exists as a working environment on the Canvas, you can drag the cluster onto the Amazon S3 working environment to initiate the setup wizard.
+
image:screenshot_backup_cvo_enable.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup and recovery Enable button which is available after you select a working environment.]

TIP: To modify backup settings or add replication, refer to link:../task-manage-backups-ontap.html[Manage ONTAP backups].

== Activate backups on your ONTAP volumes 

Activate backups at any time directly from your on-premises working environment.

A wizard takes you through the following major steps: 

* <<Select the volumes that you want to back up>>
* <<Define the backup strategy>>
* <<Review your selections>> 

You can also <<Show the API commands>> at the review step, so you can copy the code to automate backup activation for future working environments.  

=== Start the wizard 

.Steps 

. Access the Activate backup and recovery wizard using one of the following ways: 
* From the BlueXP canvas, select the working environment and select *Enable > Backup Volumes* next to the Backup and recovery service in the right-panel.
+
image:screenshot_backup_onprem_enable.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup and recovery Enable button that is available after you select a working environment.]

+
If the AWS destination for your backups exists as a working environment on the Canvas, you can drag the ONTAP cluster onto the AWS object storage.  
* Select *Volumes* in the Backup and recovery bar. From the Volumes tab, select the *Actions* image:icon-action.png["Actions icon"] icon option and select *Activate Backup* for a single volume (that does not already have replication or backup to object storage already enabled).  

+ 
The Introduction page of the wizard shows the protection options including local Snapshots, replication, and backups. If you did the second option in this step, the Define Backup Strategy page appears with one volume selected. 

. Continue with the following options: 

* If you already have a BlueXP Connector, you're all set. Just select *Next*. 
* If you don't already have a BlueXP Connector, the *Add a Connector* option appears. Refer to <<Prepare your BlueXP Connector>>. 

=== Select the volumes that you want to back up

Choose the volumes you want to protect. A protected volume is one that has one or more of the following: Snapshot policy, replication policy, backup to object policy. 

You can choose to protect FlexVol or FlexGroup volumes; however, you cannot select a mix of these volumes when activating backup for a working environment. See how to link:task-manage-backups-ontap.html#activate-backup-on-additional-volumes-in-a-working-environment[activate backup for additional volumes in the working environment] (FlexVol or FlexGroup) after you have configured backup for the initial volumes.

[NOTE] 
====
* You can activate a backup only on a single FlexGroup volume at a time. 
* The volumes you select must have the same SnapLock setting. All volumes must have SnapLock Enterprise enabled or have SnapLock disabled. (Volumes with SnapLock Compliance mode require ONTAP 9.14 or later.)
====

.Steps 

Note that if the volumes you choose already have Snapshot or replication policies applied, then the policies you select later will overwrite these existing policies. 

. In the Select Volumes page, select the volume or volumes you want to protect. 
+
* Optionally, filter the rows to show only volumes with certain volume types, styles, and more to make the selection easier. 
* After you select the first volume, then you can select all FlexVol volumes (FlexGroup volumes can be selected one at a time only). To back up all existing FlexVol volumes, check one volume first and then check the box in the title row. (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[]).
* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).

. Select *Next*.

=== Define the backup strategy 

Defining the backup strategy involves setting the following options: 

* Whether you want one or all of the backup options: local Snapshots, replication, and backup to object storage
* Architecture
* Local Snapshot policy
* Replication target and policy
+
NOTE: If the volumes you choose have different Snapshot and replication policies than the policies you select in this step, the existing policies will be overwritten. 

* Backup to object storage information (provider, encryption, networking, backup policy, and export options). 

.Steps 

. In the Define backup strategy page, choose one or all of the following. All three are selected by default: 
+
* *Local Snapshots*: If you are performing replication or back up to object storage, local Snapshots must be created. 
* *Replication*: Creates replicated volumes on another ONTAP storage system.  
* *Backup*: Backs up volumes to object storage.  

. *Architecture*: If you chose replication and backup, choose one of the following flows of information: 
* *Cascading*: Information flows from the primary storage system to the secondary, and from secondary to object storage. 
* *Fan out*: Information flows from the primary storage system to the secondary _and_ from the primary to object storage. 
+ 
For details about these architectures, refer to link:concept-protection-journey.html[Plan your protection journey]. 
 
. *Local Snapshot*: Choose an existing Snapshot policy or create a new one. 
+
TIP: To create a custom policy before activating the Snapshot, refer to link:task-create-policies-ontap.html[Create a policy].
+
To create a policy, select *Create new policy* and do the following: 
+
** Enter the name of the policy. 
** Select up to 5 schedules, typically of different frequencies. 
** Select *Create*. 

. *Replication*: Set the following options: 
+
* *Replication target*: Select the destination working environment and SVM. Optionally, select the destination aggregate or aggregates and prefix or suffix that will be added to the replicated volume name. 
* *Replication policy*: Choose an existing replication policy or create one. 
+
TIP: To create a custom policy, refer to link:task-create-policies-ontap.html[Create a policy]..
+
To create a policy, select *Create new policy* and do the following: 
+
** Enter the name of the policy. 
** Select up to 5 schedules, typically of different frequencies. 
** Select *Create*. 
. *Back up to Object*: If you selected *Backup*, set the following options: 
+
* *Provider*: Select *Amazon Web Services*. 
* *Provider settings*: Enter the provider details and region where the backups will be stored.

+
Enter the AWS Account used to store the backups. This can be a different account than where the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system resides.
+
If you want to use a different AWS account for your backups, you must add the destination AWS account credentials in BlueXP, and add the permissions "s3:PutBucketPolicy" and "s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls" to the IAM role that provides BlueXP with permissions.

+
Select the region where the backups will be stored. This can be a different region than where the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system resides.

+ 
Either create a new bucket or select an existing one. 

* *Encryption key*: If you created a new bucket, enter encryption key information given to you from the provider. Choose whether you'll use the default AWS encryption keys, or choose your own customer-managed keys from your AWS account, to manage encryption of your data. (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-kms.html[See how to use your own encryption keys]).

+ 
If you choose to use your own customer-managed keys, enter the key vault and key information. 

+ 
NOTE: If you chose an existing bucket, encryption information is already available, so you don't need to enter it now. 

* *Backup policy*: Select an existing backup-to-object storage policy or create one. 
+
TIP: To create a custom policy before activating the backup, refer to link:task-create-policies-ontap.html[Create a policy].
+
To create a policy, select *Create new policy* and do the following: 
+
** Enter the name of the policy. 
** Select up to 5 schedules, typically of different frequencies. 
** For backup-to-object policies, set the DataLock and Ransomware Protection settings. For details on DataLock and Ransomware Protection, refer to link:concept-cloud-backup-policies.html[Backup-to-object policy settings].

// In backup to object only (not snapshots and replication) for CVO to AWS, CVO to Azure, onprem to AWS, Azure, S3, and SG - can do Advanced Settings for ransomware scans and datalock. Adv Settings does not apply to Google.)
** Select *Create*. 



* *Export existing Snapshot copies to object storage as backup copies*: If there are any local Snapshot copies for volumes in this working environment that match the backup schedule label you just selected for this working environment (for example, daily, weekly, etc.), this additional prompt is displayed. Check this box to have all historic Snapshots copied to object storage as backup files to ensure the most complete protection for your volumes.

. Select *Next*. 

//.. Enter the name for the default policy. You don't need to change the name.
//.. Define the backup schedule and choose the number of backups to retain. link:concept-ontap-backup-to-cloud.html#customizable-backup-schedule-and-retention-settings[See the list of existing policies you can choose^].

//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.11.1 and greater, you can choose to protect your backups from deletion and ransomware attacks by configuring one of the _DataLock and Ransomware Protection_ settings. _DataLock_ protects your backup files from being modified or deleted, and _Ransomware protection_ scans your backup files to look for evidence of a ransomware attack in your backup files. link:concept-cloud-backup-policies.html#datalock-and-ransomware-protection[Learn more about the available DataLock settings^].
//+
//NOTE: If you plan to use DataLock, you must enable it in your first policy when activating BlueXP backup and recovery. You might want to protect your backups from deletion by using _DataLock_.

//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.10.1 and greater, you can choose to tier backups to either S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage after a certain number of days for further cost optimization. link:reference-aws-backup-tiers.html[Learn more about using archival tiers^].

=== Review your selections 

This is the chance to review your selections and make adjustments, if necessary. 

.Steps 

. In the Review page, review your selections. 
. Optionally check the box to *Automatically synchronize the Snapshot policy labels with the replication and backup policy labels*. This creates Snapshots with a label that matches the labels in the replication and backup policies.  
. Select *Activate Backup*. 

.Result 

BlueXP backup and recovery starts taking the initial backups of your volumes. The baseline transfer of the replicated volume and the backup file includes a full copy of the primary storage system data. Subsequent transfers contain differential copies of the primary storage system data contained in Snapshot copies.

A replicated volume is created in the destination cluster that will be synchronized with the primary storage volume. 

An S3 bucket is created in the service account indicated by the S3 access key and secret key you entered, and the backup files are stored there. 

The Volume Backup Dashboard is displayed so you can monitor the state of the backups. 

You can also monitor the status of backup and restore jobs using the link:task-monitor-backup-jobs.html[Job Monitoring panel^].

=== Show the API commands 

You might want to display and optionally copy the API commands used in the Activate backup and recovery wizard. You might want to do this to automate backup activation in future working environments. 

.Steps 

. From the Activate backup and recovery wizard, select *View API request*. 
. To copy the commands to the clipboard, select the *Copy* icon.
