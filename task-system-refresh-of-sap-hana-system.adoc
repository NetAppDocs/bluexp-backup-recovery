You can perform a system refresh of a source SAP HANA system, which is the production database to a target system.  The target system is refreshed with data from the source system and this target system can be used for data mining, auditing, and so on.  

== Prerequisites

* You should add the source and target HANA systems manually into cloud backup application.
* You should delete the unmounted cloned volumes manually.
* Ensure that the HANA version database version is same on source and the target system.
* You should have decided on which refresh scripts to be used.
** The refresh scripts are available in the solution technical report (TR).
** You can customize the refresh scripts.

*About this task*

* System refresh is supported only for multi-tenant database container HANA system.
* The policies (protection) will continue after the system refresh. 
* The new volumes created will have the following naming convention: <sourcevolumename>-<timestamp>
** Timestamp format: <year><month><day>-<hour><minute><second>
+
For example, if the source volume is vol1, the refreshed volume name will be vol1-20230109-184501

NOTE: The new volume will be placed in the same capacity pool as that of the target volumes.

* The Junction path will be the same as the volume name.

*Steps*

. In the BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Applications*.
. Click *Discover Applications*.
. Select *Cloud Native* > *SAP HANA* and click *Next*.
. In the *Applications* page, click image:icon-action.png[icon to select the action] icon to select the action corresponding to the system that you want to refresh and select *System Refresh*.
. In the *System Refresh* page, perform the following actions:
.. Select source system and Snapshot copy
.. Enter Export addresses from which the new volumes can be accessed
.. Enter Prescript, Postscript, and On Failure script paths
On Failure script is executed only when the system refresh operation fails.
.. Select *Delete associated SAP HANA backups*
Only Snapshot copies will be deleted.
If there are any existing backups of the target system and the above option is not selected, system refresh operation will fail.
You can also delete the backups from the *Topology* page.
.. Click *Refresh*.

== Environmental Variables

For the system refresh workflow, the following environmental variables are available as part of the prescript and postscript.

* CLONED_VOLUMES_MOUNT_PATH=172.23.10.10:/vol1-20230109-184501
* VOL1_DESTINATION=172.23.10.10:/vol1-20230109-184501
* HANA_DATABASE_TYPE="MULTIPLE_CONTAINERS"
