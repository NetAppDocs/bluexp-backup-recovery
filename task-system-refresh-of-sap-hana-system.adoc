You can perform a system refresh from a source SAP HANA system, which is the production database to a target system.  The target system is refreshed with data from the source system and this target system can be used for data mining, auditing, and so on.  

*Before you begin*

* You should add the source and target HANA systems manually into cloud backup.
* You should manually delete the unmounted cloned volumes.
* Ensure that the SAP HANA database version is same on source and the target system.
* You should have decided on which refresh scripts to be used. The refresh scripts are available in the solution technical report (TR).
You can customize the refresh scripts.
* The following environmental variables are available as part of the prescript and postscript:
** CLONED_VOLUMES_MOUNT_PATH 
** VOL1_DESTINATION 
** HANA_DATABASE_TYPE 
** TENANT_DATABASE_NAMES 

*About this task*

* System refresh is supported only for multi-tenant database container HANA system.
* The existing policies will be valid after the system refresh. 
* The new volumes created will have the following naming convention: <sourcevolumename>-<timestamp>
** Timestamp format: <year><month><day>-<hour><minute><second>
+
For example, if the source volume is vol1, the refreshed volume name will be vol1-20230109-184501

NOTE: The new volume will be placed in the same capacity pool as that of the target volumes.

* The junction path will be the same as the volume name.

*Steps*

.. Enter prescript, postscript, and on failure script paths.
On failure script is executed only when the system refresh operation fails.
