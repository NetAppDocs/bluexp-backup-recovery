You can back up one or more datastores to Microsoft Azure by integrating the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host with BlueXP. This will help the VM administrators to easily and quickly back up and archive data for storage efficiency and accelerate cloud transition.

If the datastore is associated with an archival policy, you will be provided with an option to select the archival tier. The supported archival tier is Azure Archive Blob Storage.

.Before you begin
Ensure that you have met all the link:concept-protect-vm-data.html[requirements] before backing up datastores to the cloud.

.Steps

. In BlueXP UI, click *Protection* > *Backup and recovery* > *Virtual Machines*.
. Click image:icon-action.png[action] corresponding to the datastore that you want to back up and click *Activate Backup*.
. In the Assign Policy page, select the policy and click *Next*.
. Add the working environment.
+
Configure the cluster management LIF that you want BlueXP to discover. After adding the working environment for one of the datastores, it can be reused for all the other datastores residing on the same ONTAP cluster.
+
.. Click *Add Working Environment* corresponding to the SVM.
.. In the Add Working Environment wizard:
... Specify the IP address of the cluster management LIF.
... Specify the credentials of the ONTAP cluster user.
.. Click *Add Working Environment*.
. Select *Microsoft Azure* to configure it as the cloud provider.
.. Specify the Azure subscription ID.
.. Select the region where you want to create the backups.
.. Create a new resource group or use an existing resource group.
.. Specify the IP addresses of the cluster management LIF that were added as the working environments.
.. Select the archival tier.
+
It is recommended to set the archival tier because this is an one time activity and you will not be allowed to set it up later.
. Review the details and click *Activate Backup*.
